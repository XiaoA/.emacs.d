** TODO Setup Emacs client for OSX: [[http://skife.org/emacs/mac/osx/2011/03/17/emacs-client-mac.html][Setting up Emacsclient for OSX]]
*** Additional notes on OS X / Cocoa Emacs ( [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsClient][Emacs Wiki:
I’d had a few problems connecting to the emacs server from emacsclient, until I realised I was using the default /usr/bin/emacsclient when I should’ve been using the /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient … so make a symlink,

sudo mv /usr/bin/emacsclient /usr/bin/emacsclient.old # backup the original emacsclient.
sudo ln /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient /usr/bin/emacsclient # symlink emacsclient from Emacs.app

Rather than moving a file installed by the OS, I have symlinked /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient to /usr/local/bin/emacsclient. Of course you have to make sure that /usr/local/bin comes before /usr/bin in your $PATH. - citizen428

Setting emacs to work over tcp will create the ~/.emacs.d/server/server socket file, you can then use emacsclient this way…

emacsclient  +4:14 FILE

\# opens FILE at line 4, col 14. 

(I’ve found there’s no need to specify the server, unless you are running more than one Emacs server. )

Set -a and/or -c as you like.
