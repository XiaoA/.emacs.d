<p>This is the template that I use to easily manage a static website using <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">VoodooPad 5</a> (and this page is both instructions and an example of how to use the various features). VoodooPad 5 is a good fit for your website if:</p>

<ol>
<li>You need a static site</li>
<li>That is simple enough to use a flat hierarchy</li>
<li>And only has one page template (or minor variations on a single template)</li>
</ol>

<p>For instance, I use VoodooPad for an app documentation site, but wouldn't want to use it for my blog.</p>

<p>This document is setup to use Markdown for basic styling. It would probably be possible to do the same with rich text, but the scripts in this particular template will not work right if you do. You can adjust the default type of page with the Info&rarr;Document palette.</p>

<p>This page is both documentation and an example of what you can do with this template. To see it as rendered HTML, use <strong>File&rarr;Export Document&rarr;Web Export...</strong> or <kbd class="shortcut"><kbd>command</kbd> <kbd>control</kbd> <kbd>W</kbd></kbd> and open the resulting <code>index.html</code> file in your browser of choice. (You can also use <strong>View&rarr;HTML Preview</strong> to quickly preview the page, but it will not support extra features like Markdown-Extra header IDs and breadcrumbs.)</p>

<h2 id="parts">Moveable parts</h2>

<p><strong>VPWebExportPageTemplate</strong></p>

<p>Your basic HTML template. Probably your first order of business is changing this file to setup your site's markup. If you want to use the breadcrumb feature, you will need to include <code>&lt;ul class=&quot;breadcrumbs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code> in your template. See <a href="#breadcrumbs">Using breadcrumbs</a> below.</p>

<p>By default the template uses the <a href="styles.css.html">styles.css</a> page for its CSS. You can always change this. I'm hoping to modify this template in future to allow using LESS, instead, and have it compile automatically on export (or add it yourself!), but in the short term vanilla CSS is the only thing supported.</p>

<p><strong><a href="styles.css.html">styles.css</a></strong></p>

<p>Your default stylesheet. If you want to use a different stylesheet, remember to set <code>VPDirectWriteOnHTMLExport</code> equal to <kbd class="shortcut"><kbd>1</kbd></kbd> in the Page Meta palette (otherwise it will be converted to HTML when you export it) and change the config variable <code>CSS_PAGE_NAME</code> in VPJSPrefixScript.</p>

<p><strong>VPJSPrefixScript</strong></p>

<p>This contains a list of configuration variables. Instead of mucking around in the various scripts, you can pop open this page and adjust the variables to suit your needs.</p>

<p><strong>VPNewPageTemplate</strong></p>

<p>Add anything here that you want to show up in new pages by default. Probably only necessary if you switch from using Markdown.</p>

<p><strong>VPWebExportScript</strong> and <strong>VPPageEventScript</strong></p>

<p>These handle the actual logic that goes into the special web export and page creation features. Unless you want to add something new or make a very specific change to the existing behavior, you should be able to get along by modifying VPJSPrefixScript instead.</p>

<h2 id="assets">Assets</h2>

<p>In general, you should add all of your assets to the VoodooPad project using <strong>File&rarr;Import...</strong> for images and simply creating plain text pages for Javascript and CSS (just remember to set <code>VPDirectWriteOnHTMLExport</code> to <kbd class="shortcut"><kbd>1</kbd></kbd> in the Page Meta for Javascript and CSS!). The web export scripts will automatically sort them into folders on export.</p>

<p>It is possible to define standard template files in a web export plugin, for instance, but by keeping everything within the project you can move it around a lot easier (particularly now that VoodooPad 5 supports things like synching with Dropbox or Git).</p>

<p>By default, this template will do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>*.css files are sorted into a <code>css</code> folder</li>
<li>*.jpg, *.jpeg, *.png, and *.gif files are sorted into an <code>images</code> folder</li>
<li>*.js files are sorted into a <code>js</code> folder</li>
<li>*.zip files are sorted into a <code>downloads</code> folder</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="linking">Linking</h2>

<p>In general, VoodooPad will handle all your linking needs automatically thanks to its wiki nature. However, if you need to link to a page anchor, you can do so like this:</p>

<p><em>Same page</em><br/>
<code>[Link text](#anchor)</code></p>

<p><em>Different page</em><br/>
<code>[Link text](page-name.html#anchor)</code></p>

<p>For the different page linking, you will notice that VP will highlight &quot;page-name&quot; (assuming you have a page called page-name, of course). Never fear, though! This will allow you to jump to that page easily, but it will not result in a nested link. VoodooPad is smart about that (and there's some logic in the export scripts to catch any nested links that it misses).</p>

<p>Linking to images works basically the same (whether you use HTML or Markdown). The image name will be highlighted, but you should not end up with nested links.</p>

<p>Note that you <em>must</em> use Markdown linking (or HTML linking, if working with a plain text page). Format&rarr;Add Link will only work if you are converting rich text pages.</p>

<h2 id="breadcrumbs">Breadcrumbs</h2>

<p>Breadcrumbs allow you to add some virtual hierarchy to your otherwise flat site, and this particular template uses VoodooPad's tags feature to do so. You can disable or configure breadcrumbs by modifying the configuration variables in VPJSPrefixScript.</p>

<p>There are two ways to attach breadcrumbs to a page:</p>

<p><strong>1) Tags.</strong> When you create a new page, open the Tags palette. Add a tag for the page that is parent to this page (excluding the index page, which is automatically inserted as the first breadcrumb). So for instance, if you have a &quot;Howdy Stranger&quot; page that you are using as a section landing, and you just created &quot;At the Saloon&quot; that you want to be nested underneath it in the breadcrumbs, you would add &quot;Howdy Stranger&quot; to the tags. This would result in the following markup (using default settings for the index page title; configure on VPWebExportScript):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul class=&quot;breadcrumbs&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;index.html&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;howdy-stranger.html&quot;&gt;Howdy Stranger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class=&quot;active&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#content&quot;&gt;At the Saloon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the tags are empty, you would get the Home link and the page top link only. If you add more than one tag, it will add more in-between pages but note that tags are sorted alphabetically.</p>

<p><strong>2) Page meta.</strong> If you need to have more than one breadcrumb and the alphabetical ordering of tags is causing your breadcrumbs to be ordered wrong, open the Page Meta palette instead. Add a custom meta with the key <code>breadcrumbs</code> and for the value enter your page names separated by commas. In the example above, if you have a child page of &quot;At the Saloon&quot; called &quot;Bar Fight&quot;, you would enter <code>Howdy Stranger, At the Saloon</code> for its &quot;breadcrumbs&quot; meta.</p>

<p>Regardless of where you define your breadcrumbs, you can use either page links (like &quot;howdy-stranger&quot;, which is the default name for the page if you have auto page renaming enabled in VPJSPrefixScript) or any alias assigned to the page (&quot;Howdy Stranger&quot;). In VoodooPad, aliases are case-insensitive. If what you enter is all lowercase, then the system will automatically try to convert it to title case. So if you do enter &quot;howdy-stranger&quot;, then it will automatically be converted to &quot;Howdy Stranger&quot;. Note that this can lead to capitalization inconsistencies; using the page alias that you want displayed is recommended.</p>

<p>To display your breadcrumbs, insert <code><ul class="breadcrumbs">
<li class="active"><a href="#content">Home</a></li>
</ul></code> where you would like your breadcrumb UL to show up in your VPWebExportPageTemplate.</p>

<h2 id="final">Final notes</h2>

<p>If you've read this far, congratulations! You now know pretty much everything you need to convert this from a template into your own site. To get started, simply delete this page (or copy it elsewhere if you think you might need to reference it), modify the VPWebExportPageTemplate and <a href="styles.css.html">styles.css</a> pages, and away you go!</p>

<p>When exporting, all you need to specify is the output directory. Everything else will be handled correctly (you don't even have to choose &quot;Markdown&quot; from the &quot;Export format&quot; dropbox; as long as your pages are Markdown pages--and they will be if you use this template--VoodooPad will just do the right thing automatically).</p>

<p>Enjoy! And if you add some awesome sauce of your own to the export scripts or similar, consider sharing them with me!</p>
