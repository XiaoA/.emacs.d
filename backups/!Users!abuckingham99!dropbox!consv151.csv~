<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b></b></span>Secular songs are a fascinating part of Middle Ages heritage. Choose a few of these to listen to and consider how they differ from sacred chant, Mass movements, and organum. Of course, secular music took place outside of the church, so performance practice-wise, anything goes! And when a performer is rendering a really, really old song like this in modern times, they often feel free to do things their way.

This <strong>Start Here</strong> module is meant to orient students to the course menu (note the menu options on the left, in a light turquoise color).This course is an on-ground course, but it is taught in somewhat of a hybrid format; that said, many discussions (regarding assigned readings or listening) will take place at Bb instead of in class, so students must take responsibility for understanding what is here and what is expected of them within the Bb portals. This Start Here section is lengthy, but please read each and every word for a solid foundation in Muse course procedures. </p>
<p>**<em>It is expected that Muse enrollees have clicked on every available menu option before the next class.</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Announcements</span></strong>: Instructors may communicate with students via a course Announcement. The course site opens to this module, so if there is a new announcement, it will pop right up. Pay attention to any additional instructions that may appear in a group Announcement.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Syllabus and Schedule</strong></span>: This one is self-explanatory, but note that these important documents are always just one click away, even if your hard copy is not. Consult these documents frequently and be certain that you are clear on course requirements and expectations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Useful Documents</strong></span>: The instructors will post any hand-outs here and prompt students to visit this module to peruse or retrieve any important documents (i.e., era-specific vocabulary lists).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Powerpoint for Review</strong></span>: After an in-class presentation, any Powerpoint presentations used will post here for students to click through again-- for review, refreshing, or just for fun links or ideas included.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recordings Links</strong></span><strong>:</strong> Live links to most every required piece of music for listening are posted here. This facilitates efficient listening so that students can spend adequate time with the music itself. When prompted on the Course Schedule to listen to a specific piece, visit this module for a link directly to the required excerpt. There will also be links and/or recording information about <em>recommended</em> listening pieces here.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Score Links</strong></span>: Links to online scores or to PDF score files to match the uploaded recordings are posted here. Students should ALWAYS plan to listen actively with a score. Scores for required listening and recommended listening pieces are posted here.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Readings</strong></span>: Links to most required readings (outside of the Wade textbook) are available here. Again, this facilitates efficient access to materials, so students may spend adequate, focused time with the reading material. Also, access the <strong>Required/Recommended </strong>list<strong> </strong>at the &quot;Useful Documents&quot; menu option. This table offers an at-a-glance format for more information regarding required readings, plus ideas for supplemental readings that may further inspire and engage students in course material.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Discussion Board</strong></span>: This is the place for completing individual and group participation assignments. Here students find at least 2 forums per week, and everyone will participate actively by creating a new &quot;thread&quot; or replying to colleagues' posts. This is clearly a critical part of the overall earned grade (see attendance and participation rubric), and students must not fall behind.
