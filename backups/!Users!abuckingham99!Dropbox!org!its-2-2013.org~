| January 17th Conference             | Finished | I believe it went well!                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Remedy Template Ideas               | Active   | The Call Center staff have been brainstorming on this. I'm looking forward to setting this up.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Staff Interviews                    | Finished | I'm happy with our choices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Staff Training                      | Active   | They're both off to a great start, and actively helping users.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Live Chat canned responses          | Inactive | I've created a number of canned responses and useful links, available at the press of a button, to everyone working on the chat. I will probably add more later...                                                                                    |
| Feher Performance Plan              | Active   | Feher seems to be doing better. I will continue to work with him to make sure he continues to perform well.                                                                                                                                           |
| Update Staff Training Documentation | Active   | Last semester, we only had a folder of documentation, with little organization. I've been working on improving and updating the organization. I hope that eventually, our Student Assistants will be able to take over at least some of the training. |
| OneNote documentation               | Active   | I've added a lot of content, and have more on my list to create/update.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Website documention                 | Active   | I've been working with Kelsey and James; I have more that I'd like to work with them to include.                                                                                                                                                      |

*** ITS Staff Meeting
**** Agenda/Notes
1. Workload
   - We talked about our workload on the 3rd week. It's slowing down...
2. Website re-do
   - We're at the point where we need to fill in holes and expand on
     existing documentation.
   - David will look at the E-Tools links and make sure they point to
     other websites.
   - David will also look at the "Last Updated" script to see why it's
     not working.
3. Testing Center
   - We agreed not to put up anything on the website yet. I'm not
     going to be involved in this for this semester.
4. Call for New Training
   - Some of my ideas:
     + Grade Center
     + Turnitin (Jing's doing one)
     + Respondus
     + Group Work/Collaboration
     + Discussion Board
5. Creating Strategic Goals
   - I suggested that we look at improving internal documentation and
     training programs
     + We need to update and expand upon our current training
       documentation.

SCHEDULED: <2013-02-11 Mon>
If you click on the "Review this Presentation" link for Presentations
2.1 - 2.3, the links appear to be broken. We tested this through both
the "CourseMap" section and through the Dicussion Board. For example:


Compare the links 2.1 for the Discussion Board and CourseMap:

2.1 Discussion Board
https://blackboard.umkc.edu/bbcswebdav/courses/UMKC-COMM-ST400P-0002-15203-SP2013/SituationResearch/engage.html

2.1 CourseMap
https://blackboard.umkc.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-887235-dt-content-rid-4076970_1/xid-4076970_1
"Situation Analysis and Recommended Research"

Neither of those links work. But if you look at 2.4 or higher, the
links work. For example:

***** Grade Challenges

According to UMKC's Blackboard Policies on Student Data Retention
([[http://www.umkc.edu/ia/it/blackboard/bbpolicies.aspx#retention]]),
"It is the instructors' responsibility to download a copy
of their sites' gradebooks and any other student data which they need
to retain in order to comply with the University's policies on Records
Retention."

Student data is pulled one week before the official
start of every semester. Instructors should archive their student data
by then, but they can contact us before that date if they have a
reasonable reason for needing to keep student data
enabled. Step-by-step instructions on how to archive student data can
be found here: http://www.umkc.edu/ia/it/blackboard/bbpolicies.aspx#retention.

ITS normally charges $50 per course to restore student data for
instructors who have not backed up their own gradebook before the
semester purge date. In cases where the entire course needs to be
restored to respond to a formal grade challenge, the fees are
waived. If your situation meets this criterion, please have your
department chair or Dean send us an email listing the following
information:
- the course details
- the names of the students to be re-enabled
- the approximate date until which the information needs to be kept
  available on the production Blackboard server.

Once we have received this information, an ITS staff member will
restore the necessary data and inform you promptly when the restored
course site is ready.

**** Grade Center Issue
Professor,

Sorry it took so long to get back to you. I did some testing, and
found that if a student takes a test with your settings, he or she
can advance without choosing an answer, but they would receive a
warning (See attached screenshot). In other words, it's extremely
unlikely that the student could have gone though all of those
questions without realizing that she was not answering them.

I know you've already reset her test. I'm not sure how much this
helps, but if you have any other questions, please feel free to
contact us.

**** Wimba
Professor,

I spoke with Jing, our Wimba specialist. You can access the Wimba
classroom, and when you're in there, the instructor can right click on
your name, and then elevate you to a "Presenter" role. She recommended
that you and the other instructors test this out.

You also asked about the "Talk lock" feature. That feature should be
available to anyone, regardless of their role in the course. I would
suggest that you make sure your Java is updated, as missing tools or
features are usually caused from outdated or problematic Java
installations.

You might try a different browser. A couple weeks ago, we found that
Internet Explorer for Windows and Firefox for Mac were working better;
Java has been updated so quickly that this may not be true
anymore. I've tested Firefox on Windows and Safari on Mac, and they
were working better this week. Unfortunately, Java is updated very
frequently, so you and your students will need to make sure that you
keep it updated, and that you are ready to try a different browser if
one does not work as well at any given time.

To ensure that you have the latest Java installed, please follow these directions:

Dr. Thompson,



We do not have guest access for Bb classes.  I am adding the Bb team to this thread to see what they can do to help in your request.  Ideally, you would require Thomas to enroll in a unique section that would auto control this access.

Doug,

Thank you for responding so quickly. I’m not sure I understand your concern, unless I do not understand guest access (which is quite possible). I was seeking to have him added as a guest student, which would not give him access to other students’ private materials, only the same resources that I’ve made available to all students. He would then get all email and other resources I send to students enrolled, which would be important since I announce our group meetings via email.

Each doctoral faculty member is given a different section number for the course so that students whose dissertations they chair can sign up for their credits with their chair; the Bb site comes with the course number. But with the IPhD, the student is expected to consult with other members of their committee and their co-discipline advisor (which I am for Thomas) provides input into their dissertation, as well as their annual evaluation for SGS. For me, this is my only section of the course and he would not get credit for the course. His primary discipline for IPhD is English, where he would be signed up for dissertation credits with his chair.

Andrew, in Bb Help, indicated that there are times when this type of request is honored for students who are making up an incomplete, but not enrolled in the course. For an ABD doctoral student, their unfinished dissertation is an incomplete.

Dr. Thompson –


Unfortunately, I will not approve this request.  I would suggest having all course materials available in the primary course.  Having Thomas added to a different Blackboard section would appear confusing to the end user and could result in a FERPA issue if the content is really different between the courses.



Thanks,

Subject: FW: Question From UMKC Blackboard Request System



Hi Doug,

I hope the semester is going well for you. I need to have a person (Thomas Ferrel) enrolled in my dissertation course in Blackboard (Bb)—EDUL 5696 0007 Diss Admin—as a guest so that he has access to all materials and discussion as other students. He is an IPhD student and because I am his co-discipline advisor, he cannot enroll in this course b/c he is enrolled with his primary discipline advisor. I will likely need him enrolled in subsequent semesters as well.

Also, I am suggesting guest status b/c I can’t think of another way for him to have student status where the course does not show up on his transcript or require him to have a grade. If there is another option that I should be considering, please let me know.

It is my understanding that we need your approval for this to happen. I’ll look to hear from you so that I can notify Bb.

Thanx in advance.

Good Morning Dr. Thompson,



                Our current implementation and policy structure does not allow for guests in Blackboard courses.  There are a few workarounds that we can implement.  The first would involve creating copy of the course that only you and Thomas Ferrell would have access too.  The other would be having Thomas Ferrell enrolled in the course with a rank higher than that of student.  However this does pose a risk as he will be granted some degree of freedom to make changes to either the course or the grade book.  Perhaps even both.  If you have any questions or need any assistance please feel free to contact us.



Regards,

Feher

I’d like to add a guest to EDUL 5696 0007 Diss Admin &. The individual is Thomas Ferrel (ferrelt@umkc.edu). He cannot be enrolled as a student, but I want him to have all the privileges of students in the class. Is this possible?
