// Functions & if / else

// An especially useful application of reusable code is if/else statements. These can be very wordy, and a pain to type repeatedly.

// We are going to write a function that takes a person's income as the parameter. Inside the function will be an if / else statement. We want the function to be available to check whether many different people's income qualifies for them for a credit card.
// Instructions

//     Write a function called creditCheck that takes the parameter income.
//     Inside the function, write an if statement where if the income is greater than or equal to 100, the computer will return "You earn a lot of money! You qualify for a credit card."
//     If the income is less than 100, have the computer return "Alas you do not qualify for a credit card. Capitalism is cruel like that."
//     Call the function passing in an income of 75
//     AFTER you call it with 75, call it with 125
//     AFTER you call it with 125, call it with 100. Have to be sure!

// Stuck? Get a hint!

// Don't forget to put semi-colons at the end of each line of code inside the { }. And to put a semi-colon at the very end of the function.

   Today was a challenging day. Yesterday, I stayed home, because I didn't feel well. On Monday, the lymph node in my leg swelled up, which hadn't happened since that time in Japan when I hurt my achilles tendon and put my back out. Like then, I've had too much work, stress, and bad food, and not enough rest and exercise. Point taken. I love how our bodies gently try to educate us. I have to learn not to ignore those messages.

   Because I'd slept so much, I decided to go into work today, and come home early. But there were numerous problems, so I really only left about 30 minutes early.

   When I got home, I helped YH with her reading homework, and watched a bit of the Jerry Seinfeld documentary, "Comedian."

On the way home tonight, there was a disturbance at the Woolworth's at 75th and Wornall. I didn't see what happened, but I noticed two young African-American males yelling at a police officer. Suddenly, a whole bunch of police showed up, and the yelling continued. I'm not sure what happened, but I hope no one got hurt.

Labor Day 2013. I got up this morning and went for a walk around Bridlespur. It's the first time I've just gone for a walk (for the sake of taking a walk) in a long time. Maybe in more than two years...could that really be right? It wasn't hot, and it was so nice, that I took another short walk around our complex tonight, after dinner. I dumped off some cardboard to recycle, and I dropped off a check for the rent at the clubhouse.

This weekend, I watched the entire sixth season of "Burn Notice" on Netflix. It was fun. And I just finished the DVD of "Comedian," so I can send that back tomorrow. 

This last week, I had a flareup of the lymph node in my left leg. It's something that happened to me for the first time in Japan, and it was startling. But I stayed home one day, and it got better. But on Saturday night, it got bad again. Ever since I came back from Japan, I've been playing fast and loose with my diet and health; it was fun to be able to eat all the junk I've missed. But the truth is, I've been feeling progressively worse. Towards the end of my time in Japan, I used to get up early and go to the park in Ogikubo and do qigong. I need to have that kind of habit again. I need to eat better and do gentle exercise, like walking and qigong. I don't care about being all ripped or "athletic," but I do need to feel better, and take care of my health.

But this is a really positive time for me. Alexander was talking to me about "self-authorship." I have more to say about that, but I'm ready to call it a night. The one thing I will say is that I'm a couple days away from the ten-year anniversary of my trip to Japan. Hard to believe...and I feel a great deal of nostalgia for that time. But I think I've felt a bit gun shy, because it didn't work out as I'd hoped. But it's time to move beyond that, I think. I am ready to make new goals and start working towards a new dream.

Another long day at work. I was by myself a lot, but I made it.

This night, ten years ago, was my last night in Seattle (as a resident). Hard to believe. It seems like a lifetime ago. But sometimes, it seems like only yesterday.

I have find that spirit of hope and adventure, even though I am older and not as naive.

** <2013-09-04 Wed>
Ten years ago, I was on a plane to Japan. I was probably watching that video about Tokyo. I didn't catch all of it, but I remember the part about people meeting at Hachiko. :)

It's all so bizarre. It was such a huge part of my life, but it's over.

Ten years ago, I said goodbye to my life in Seattle. That city...that time...I truly find it hard to let go. Most of my time in Japan was, frankly, boring. Would things have gotten so boring in Seattle? I guess I'll never know.

** <2013-09-05 Thu>

The problem with our modern lifestyle is that it's completely at odds with nature, or even a traditional understanding of how to live. We're always "plugged in" and online, sharing our every thought and activity with everyone. It's a dull roar of people trying to shout over each other, but spread throughout the entire world, on phones, computers, iPad, etc.

We need rest and reflection. We need downtime and introspection. We need to be offline and unavailable. I always notice so many people just *cannot* let their phones ring. You don't have to answer it!

Today, I helped Dad get rid of some trash at the locker, and then I went back to their house to help Mom copy the music over to her new laptop. After that, Dad and I went to Aldi and picked up some groceries. YH made him some brownies.

He's really under a lot of stress. He has a couple of job prospects that are promising. Hope something works out for him soon.

I watched "The Doors" again (I saw it a long time ago). It was intersting. I'm curious about how accurate it was. I think Stone portrayed Morrison as a violent (he tried to kill Pam in a fire???), arrogant, and out-of-control druggie. He was no saint, but I don't think that he was as violent or wild as the movie portrayed him.

Just checked. As expected, Oliver Stone took a lot of "liberties," according to the forum discussion on this site: [[http://thedoors.com/forums/index.php?showtopic%3D21325][http://thedoors.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=21325]].

So, "Team USA" is still embroiled in battles all over the place; most of which aren't even talked about anymore. We're still fighting in Afganistan and Iraq; not to mention all of the bases we still have all over the world. It's big business. American business. War.

Now, our politicians are pushing for war in Syria.

I don't want to see a return of the chaos of the Sixties, but I have to wonder...when will people have enough? When will it be enough???

We're the richest country in the world, by far, but we "can't afford" to take care of our citizens, provide decent health care, education, and opportunties for people to be happy, healthy, and productive? But somehow, we can afford yet another costly war. And we /must/, of course, keep doling out corporate welfare and tax breaks to the richest few.

It sickens me. Our society is asleep; bloated with junk food, and junk entertainment. Everyone's got their faces stuck to their gadgets and games, pontificating about bullshit on Facebook all the time. I don't care about your drunken night on the town, people.

Where is the vision for the future? Where is our concern for others? This society really is like the Realm of the Hungry Ghosts. We're all so worried that someone else might have gotten a special perk or free ride, that we let all the jackals at the top of food chain devour an increasingly large percentage of the pie.

Don't take away my "freedom" to buy a gun without any kind of licensing or oversight. Don't make me pay for a bridge or a school or a road that I won't use. I don't want my precious money to be used to help other people~!

There's more than enough for us to have a brilliant and happy society. But we're too stupid and self-destructive for that. 


We had /one/ stupid war in the 60s/70s, and people fought it bitterly. Now, we have several, but people just accept it, for the most part. Maybe the memory of how the country was ripped apart during that time is too painful, and we don't want that again. Or maybe we're just so stressed and tired, and trying to survive, that we don't dare upset the wagon cart. For the most part, we have no pension system, or any way of guaranteeing that we'll end up with enough money at the end of our lives to live in reasonable comfort. Our only chance is to invest in real estate or the Stock Market. I think people know that they have no choice but to support the Corporate/Military machinery, of they'll have nothing.

Today, I went out for a walk. I left at 10am, and when I got back an hour later, it was raining. I think I found Larry Rupp's house. I made a huge circle around State Line, from Red Bridge Road and coming back along Carondolet. 

The tenent above us threw a pail of water down through the deck, and it splashed on to ours. I'm going to complain about the noise and other issues with (her?); this was the final straw.

I had something more to write, but I forget what it was. Perhaps I'll remember tomorrow. 
** <2013-09-18 Wed>
Today, Molly, Mary and I had lunch at the cafeteria. They both had some odd concoction of meat and bbq sauce. I passed on that. Instead, I had some pizza and overly watery "Alfredo" pasta.

** <2013-09-21 Sat>

Dad took me to the locker. I paid Angela's locker while he went and dumped some trash. I then went back to their house and helped them and visited with Mom a bit. He and I also went to Office Depot to get a new lawnmower. They didn't have it, but he was able to order it online and have it delivered at home.

Today, I started a 12-week online course on R/Statistics, at [[https://class.coursera.org/stats1-002/class]]. I also started working on a basic online R tutorial series at [[http://tryr.codeschool.com]].

I'm looking forward to improving my knowledge of R and statistics!

19:26. I just got back from a quick walk. It's getting darker earlier now, and there's a coolness in the air that betrays the coming frost. 

I thought about so much, as I walked through the Bridlespur neighborhood. I thought about my choices, and my relationship with my wife and my family. I thought about my friends, and about where I'm going. Earlier today, I went to the store with my parents. It's hard for me to deal with my mom, because she's so far gone. I've thought a lot about her delutional behavior, and whether I've enabled it in the past by giving her money and lending her too willing an ear. And recently, I've pulled away, and resolved myself to fight with her, to denounce her inaccurate tales of her own purity and martyrdom. But tonight, I thought that perhaps it's not my place. Maybe I should just let her say what she will, because it doesn't matter, and to be disrespectful would only cause us both more pain. I guess it's not my job to correct her or try to change her. Especially since I know that she's not really rational, because of her illness, her medication, and years of inadequate sleep.

I try so hard to correct everyone at work, and that is my job. But in the end, I can't solve every problem, and sometimes, I have to just step back and let things fall in their natural rhythm. 

What thoughts I had, and what beauty I saw in the sky. It rained most of the day, but the sun came out towards the end. I looked up in marvel at the clouds, drenched in pink, purple, and orange hues, carelessly floating across the darkening sky. Despite all of the ugliness of our government and our society, there is still a world of beauty and tranquility, just beyond the roar of the traffic, and the hiss of our modern communication. The real "Internet" is the universe that is in plain view of all, but seen by so few; all of the atoms and elements, and the stars and the planets, hurling through space. From up there, how small my problems must be!

My friend is starting over again. And I feel I might be, too. Not long ago, I felt like I was too old and I'd boxed myself in, but he said that I was still young, and I still had time. I see that he was right. And now, he is almost as old as I was, and he faces a somewhat similar crossroads, I think. But it's OK, because all we can do is take steps towards our future, not knowing for sure if it was the "right" choice or the "wrong" choice, but only knowing that as long as we exist, we must keep walking.

   this is the beginning of a new attempt to use org-mode for my outlining/authoring needs. i'm not sure if i'll go all out and use it as my pim again, but i am loving it so far. i used it back in november 2010, but eventually decided to stop. but the truth is, org-mode is unbelievable. i love vim, and the speed of modal editing, but the latex editing power of emacs and org-mode are hard to beat. mmd, pandoc, and a lot of the other tools are pretty nice, and i may end up going that way, but it just seems like none of them can match the features and community that org-mode enjoys.

i'm at umkc now, on the ground floor of miller-nichols library (or is it just nichols library now?). i successfully submitted my transcript request. now all i have to do is fill out the fafsa info and wait. it's really interesting coming back here. it's actually fun. all of my old baggage and bad feelings have disappeared. those feelings, and the /tortured young man/ who felt them, are gone. this is a new opportunity, and a new chance to begin a new chapter of my life.

it's really hot out. i'd better go ahead and look around for a few minutes here, and then head home. i might stop by the education building on the way back. i'd like to look around the whole campus, but that will probably have to wait for another time.

** mon jul 11 21:51:50 2011

   after i left the library, i took a brief walk around the campus. i stepped into scofield hall and haag hall. i also walked through the education building. i was impressed. they've done a lot to not only improve the ybuildings, but also the student space. it seems  a lot more like a "real" university community than when i was there before.

i think this could be a really good thing for me. the

i've been taking org-mode slowly this time. instead of trying to get it all tricked out immediately, like i did last time, i am sticking with a moderately simple workflow for now. i did a brain dump, and i also imported tasks into one file, and sorted them into a few basic categories. i want to leave it like that for a while, and get a feel for how things flow.

i do miss some vim commands, but overall, emacs is really nice. there are a lot of really nice touches, and i can always use vim keyboard commands, if i want. i might set up a quick way to toggle in and out of viper mode, for example. but so far, i am enjoying emacs, and i honestly don't miss vim as much as i thought i would.

and org-mode is *incredible*.

** fri aug 26 22:20:05 2011

i've gone back and forth between vim and emacs. it's too early to say
that emacs and org-mode will stick this time. :) i miss some things
about vim, that's for sure.

today, my checks and debit card came. unfortunately, i don't have any
money in my account yet, but it will come...

i've been looking at whether i can replace vimwiki in emacs. muse-mode
and freex-mode are promising wikis, but i think org-mode might have
all the features i need, plus a lot more, to boot.
** sun aug 28 18:14:35 2011

this is part of an email that i am sending to alexander:

*** i envy people with a strong sense of "purpose."

when i was a kid, i read tons and tons of biographies. history and biographies were my favorites; i've never been as big of a fan of fiction as i have of history and people...of cultures and languages...and i've always been drawn to the idea of people who were so driven to accomplish their goals, that they worked hard and believed in themselves. i think part of the appeal has been that i am so addh that it's taken me all this time to reach the same level of self-discipline and organization that your typical 5th grader has. and i fall off the wagon daily. :)

when i have a sense of purpose, i can go without eating or sleeping. but if i am not excited or motivated, i find it hard to put forth any effort. this is still an issue for me.

what scares me is that i am afraid that this degree i am doing is more of an "i guess it is good" or "i guess i should" rather than a feeling of "this is it." i'll be honest, tesol does *not* motivate me or interest me. and i feel like an ass when i say that, but it is true. and hearing the other students, who all talk about how they want to teach esl makes me feel a bit bad. the reality is that i have more real experience than pretty much any of the students i met, and i am probably better at it, frankly. but it doesn't grab me. i feel like i'm getting an mba. and that's cool, because we've already been over this, and i know that i can take this in a lot of directions. and i might change my mind about tesol, anyway. i do think this is a good move for me. i just wish i were excited about it.

and that brings me to the core of my anxiety. the last time i was "excited" about something was when i first got to japan. don't get me wrong, i get excited about a lot of things. for example, i am grateful every day for my life with yeonhwa. she is definitely the best thing that has ever happened to me in my life. but i haven't felt like i was on the right career path, or really going in the right direction /overall/ since early 2004, or maybe late 2003, even. it's not 2011, and that kinda freaks me out.

i agree that kristen's example is a good one. i think it's good to take time and do it right. but then, as you know, i tend to get all "hamlet" and agonize over every decision, until it's too late. i don't want to do that, either. i worry that i am not ready for grad school...not mature enough. not inspired enough.

whatever. it's already in progress, so i have to keep going forward. and i want to. but i still hope that things will make sense for me. maybe they won't, but i think that over time, they will. looking back already, i see how little things lead me to where i am. and the present path is no exception. but i really need to have a goal and a purpose; a story i can tell myself when the going gets tough. for now, i think that is graduation. you've mentioned the same issue...once you got your phd, what came next? i think we kinda share that same personality.

so where does that leave someone like me, who has this strong desire to feel like i am being pulled by my fate, when i am really just pulled in a thousand directions? either way, it's all in my mind. i can't control my life or what happens in the world, but i can control how i respond. i have to find that center, and maybe that whole "fake it until you make it" mentality is correct. but somehow, i can't fool myself. i have to find my center.

i guess i am starting to think that we can't all have such a strong sense of purpose. after all, people like that often miss a lot of scenery in their life, chasing that one goal. and i am too eager to experience as many different things in life as i can. maybe that is my strength, even. but sometimes, it makes it hard to push through the gray times, when it's hard to see the payoff.

*** it's all arbitrary.

one of the great discoveries i've made in my adulthood is that i'm nothing special, and i don't have some "great destiny." so in the end, it just doesn't matter. i guess it is childish to want to feel like i have some great destiny, but i can't help myself sometimes.

i mentioned that show, "flashforward." the interesting thing for me is that people saw the future, but then as the series unfolds, many of the characters grapple with the question of whether they can change their fate. can the future be changed, or is it set? and if it can be changed, should it be?

ultimately, my life, in the scope of the universe, is as insignificant as a dream, or an episode of that show. it's just the dreaming of a tiny speck of life, on a tiny planet. :) but for me, it is the most important question of all...who am i, and why am i here?

my "challenge" is resolving these issues, and then letting go, and realizing that life should be lived, rather than "planned out." and in the end, all i can do is my best, and let go. who knows what it all means, and who cares how it all turns out for me? or maybe my challenge is just to see that i am just a cog...?

today, i went over and helped mom. unfortunately, we didn't get as much done as i would have hoped; ray jr. came over for a while. but we did get some things done, and i think she enjoyed having company.

after i got home, we had some great soup that yeonhwa'd made, and then angela and i watched america's got talent. only two more weeks of that...

tomorrow, i'll need to finish and submit my first reaction paper and question for 5546.  time for bed.

today, my money finally showed up in my account. i updated 1password (family account), and we walked to us bank, to get cash for my haircut.

angela and i took jewel to the vet at 18:00, and i picked up a few things, like new water filters and chai tea, at target.
it's way past time for bed.

yesterday, we went to sleep one to look at mattresses. we ended up getting one. hopefully, it will work out. we'll get it on tuesday. when i paid for it, i found out that my card limit is $1000, and i had to split the payment up over two days. today, i called a.j. back and paid the second half.

we went over the lockers. i paid for july - september, and then we went to sonic for some ice cream. i had a pumpkin shake. it was nice. yeonhwa had a chocolate malt, and angela had a fudge sundae. then we went to microcenter, and i got a new external hard drive. it took about 2.5 hours to back up the whole thing!

mom and dad were planning to come over, but they didn't. they might come over tomorrow. tomorrow is labor day.

oh, and angela had to run into her office, so we got a little tour. i'd been on campus with her in the car, but was the first time for me to see where she works. it was interesting.
** tue sep  6 22:13:09 2011
today, our bed came. in just a few minutes, we'll be sleeping on it for the first time. :)

i wanted to write yesterday, but i was too tired. we had a nice day; i got some insoles at the waldo cvs, and then i got some white new balance shoes. we tried a chicago pizza from papa murphy's. it was good. then, angela and i went to price chopper.

today, i worked on my upcoming reflection paper, and angela and i went pick up some books we had on hold at the library, and we stopped off at the waldo hardware store. not only do we have a comfortable bed, but we also fixed up our curtains! i think we're going to sleep well tonight...



** mon sep 26 21:49:46 2011
i'm ready for bed. i have to get up really early tomorrow. i start my new job down on campus tomorrow. i'm looking forward to it. but i will be even busier from now on.

we got up to iowa at about 4pm. barbara asked us to write something
for grandma's eulogy.
*** grandma remembrance for her eulogy
she was a simple and sincere person, who dedicated her life to
serving others. her life was filled with simple
pleasures at home, but she loved hearing about the adventures of her
children and grandchildren.

her greatest joy was celebrating the successes of her
friends and family, and she was always quick to offer a kind word of
encouragement.

i lived in japan for many years, and it always tickled her to hear my
stories and see the pictures i took every day. she was always amazed
that i could be so far away, and half a day ahead of her, but sound so
near on the phone.

no matter how minor my accomplishments were, she always had a
way of making me feel like they were special and interesting to her.

she always wanted to know about the weather, or about the way people
dressed and lived, and the food they ate in other places. i shared
so many things with her, but i still find myself thinking of things
that i would like to tell her. she taught me how to approach
everything in life with wonder and appreciation.

Today will be the hardest day of the funeral. i got up early for
breakfast, and met Cecil. i didn't actually recognize him, but he

Today, I made [[file:recipe.org::Absolutely%20Ultimate%20Potato%20Soup][potato soup]]. But it was different from the recipe, because I didn't have all the ingredients, like bacon. It was good, though.
In the morning, we had some tiny piece of sleet on the balcony. It was a cloudy and cold day.

I watched a few episodes of "Miami Vice" on Netflix. As usual, she and I also watched another episode of "Monk" at dinner (potato soup). It was Season 8, Episode 10, the one where Sharona comes back.

*** Admissions email

Hello,

My wife has a somewhat unique situation, which was not really answered by the website. :)

Here is a brief summary:

- She is a Chinese citizen, but she has her Green Card, so she is not an F-1 International Student.
- She went to a high school in China. That high school closed and merged with another school. She has a diploma, but they did not give her transcripts.
- She went to an English college and earned a 3-year degree in Business and English. She also has a diploma/degree, but they did not issue grades. From what she's told me, she did not study Math, History, Science, or anything else that would be transferrable in college. She just learned English as a Foreign Language.
- I can't remember if she has both her high school and college diploma here, or just one of them. I believe she might only have her college diploma.
- She was a visiting student at UMKC one year ago. She studied English at the ALI, and received a certificate that says her English is good enough to study at UMKC now.

Here is my problem. She wants to go to school, and she knows she has to start over, because the college/university system in China is completely different, and she hasn't taken the courses she would need to get her degree in the US. But we're having problems figuring out how to get her into college, because her schools did not issue grades in the same that we do here. I can send her back to China to try to get these grades, but I'd like to make sure that we get the correct documentation, because having her go back to China to get this would obviously be a very difficult and expensive proposition for us at the moment, so I want to make sure we don't make any mistakes

I have a lot to say, but it's late, and my fingers are sore from typing. Here is a email I just wrote to Alexander. For now, I guess it sums up some of what I was thinking today...

***
There’s a “Part II” that I had in my head before, but I don’t know if I remember it all well enough to really articulate it. I guess it’s mostly this…

There’s a lot about myself that I don’t know, and I a lot I do. But there’s a lot about myself that I’ve denied for a long time, and I don’t want to do that anymore. I don’t want to wait, or put it off, or be on hold. (Which was part of what I was saying about the whole, “I’ll be awesome later, when I’m ready thing.”)

I’m awesome now. I just need to accept where I am going and be true to myself. I remember 10 years ago, I’d gone to Japan, but I had to work to survive. I made a deal with myself that I’d just fit in and work and do whatever I needed to do, until I could be in a position to do what I wanted. Because I thought what I wanted was weird or whatever and i was tired of that and i wanted to be normal. It’s so much to explain…but i mean i wanted to be a martial artist and all that…

Today, it’s not about the details of what I wanted. Or the exact goals I had. It’s the feeling I miss. It’s the fact that I’m at my best when I have a “crazy” dream. I’ve been thinking about this for a long time, but I guess it kinda took the New Year (more or less) to really push me over the edge. I don’t know what my dream is, exactly, how it will take shape. But I *know* how it feels. I can’t explain it more than that right now. 

It’s like this..don’t laugh, but I thought…what if I start working out and I become a personal trainer and i show people pictures of me and I tell them that I was a 39 year-old fatass, busted up, but I changed. Or what if I become a counselor and I tell people that I was a neurotic mess, who didn’t really get his act together until middle age? :)

I know that I want to be someone who is authentic and centered and wise. It’s what I’ve always wanted. I don’t the best way, with the time, strength and limitations that I have, to do that. But I don’t want to just be “normal” and eat, sleep, work, shit and die. It’s not even that I want to be better than anyone, or famous or admired, or anything.

I just want to be true to myself and I can literally remember looking out the window of my classroom in Ichigaya, Tokyo…and when I “put myself on hold” and now, I officially and pressing the “Pause” button again and resuming MY life.
***

I tweaked my knee on the ice the other day..the one I fell on before in Japan. I’ve done this kind of thing before, so I know it’s not serious, but it’s a sign that I need to strengthen my leg better. My ligaments are too tight and my leg is too week. I never pushed myself to rehab it correctly. In my experience, it will be ok in a day or so. And also my elbow is a bit sore. So I couldn’t push myself too much physically. But it’s like I said..not all or nothing. I did little things. I took the stairs more. I was at two bus stops on the way home. I did some simple “sit down on the bench and get up” movements…like a lazy man’s squat. And at one bus stop, I grabbed the side of the shelter and leaned back, put all my weight on my heels leaning backwards, and pulled myself upright. Not a very hard “workout” but it was still a small positive step in the right direction. And it felt good.

And it made me smile, because I thought maybe I could invent a new style of covert exercise that looks like a guy who is being impatient or something, but is actually just trying to take a tiny baby step towards better health.

The other thing I was going to say is that I’m the world’s greatest “self con artist” so while I don’t like scales, don’t think weight or calories are good metrics…I think I might get a scale that measures fat, weight, muscle and bone density, and just record that. And also record, roughly what kind of exercise I did, and also keep track of other things, like what I did positive to help others/myself for the day, and what my dreams or interests are. 

This is something I’ve been moving towards for a long time. It’s only be really writing down and measuring, at least in some way, what I was doing, thinking, and working towards, that I can hope to have any chance of making objective progress towards a goal.

So the thing about dreaming big, it’s something I said before, but I want to keep asking myself what I want to do. One day, it’s this..next day, it’s that..but over time, if I write it down, I can go back and read it and I think it will be clearer. I’ve fallen off the journaling wagon, but I think it’s the key for me. Just like a bit of exercise every day…a bit of quantification and journaling will go a long way. i don’t want to be that guy that measures everything he eats and does. But again…it’s not all or nothing. It’s about keeping tabs on the part of me that means well, but needs a bit of structure. :)

****

I think for so long, I've been trying to figure out what I wanted to do in my career, and what I should "be." But I'm already me! I think I've been looking at this the wrong way, and it's time to turn that on it's head...In this economy, with the way our society and technology is changing so fast, everything is in flux. Entire industries and career paths have come and gone...just since I graduated from college! So I think that I'm lucky that I have many talents and interests, because it makes me flexible and open to new ideas.

Even now, I'll probably change careers a couple times in my life. And the more I think about, the more I think that, even if only on the side, an entreprenuerial path is really useful. It's going to be good for me to have more than one option, and ideally more than one income stream going. I have to let myself be open the divergent ideas and ways of thinking, but disciplined and centered enough to focus well enough to merge them into a successful way of living.

This is some of what I was thinking about today.
** <2014-01-13 Mon>
An email I sent to Alexander:
i’ve torn my achilles twice and gone through the balcony…i’ve known for a long time that i wasn’t taking care of my rehab and rebuilding myself. i managed the pain and you know, could walk, even run when needed. But I’ve had issues with wobbliness, soreness and all that sometimes. i was afraid to really “push” myself too hard.

but it’s funny…i’ve been just really, really slowly walking and doing very light exercise…and it’s amazing because my legs are so much strong already. i can feel it when i walk up stairs. no pain and really strong and steady. to be fair, i didnt always have pain in my knee but i was very prone to tweaking it all the time because my leg has been tight and very weak.

i’m not really changing my diet yet; i’m not working out that hard. i just do some basic exercise, and mostly just walk and use the stairs more. and i’m already starting to feel better. it’s not obvious yet. i still look the same. but i feel so much better. it’s awesome. the truth is, i’m still young and i can just slowly, slowly improve and still be strong and healthy, and that’s really something that makes me feel relieved. i feel like i’m taking this long road back to where i’ve always been going. i could have taken a straighter path. i should have. but if you keep going, sometimes you’re lucky enough to find your way back to your *real* self and what matters.

i’ve been back almost three years, but i finally feel like i’m coming back “home” to my own life. i’m not there yet. but i will be, with a bit of luck and determination.
** <2014-02-19 Wed>
*** Putting myself last

I came home and XiaoXue was upset about her Composition class being canceled. For some reason, it upset me and I got annoyed with her. It caused a lot of grief for us, which I didn't want. I think we're ok now (21:56), but it's a waste.
The truth is, I don't feel that great. The stress of this job is catching up to me, and I'm getting worried about my health.

I went to MU back in December, and never turned in my gas receipt. Now, I have to get that money through my check and it will be taxed, because it's past the two month deadline for turning it in. And I had to drop my classes. All of this because of a job that is so meaningless. I'm right back where I was.

Here's a pretty instructive email. Look at the part I wrote today, which pretty much sums it up...

I changed my mind. fuck the equivocal email from before. the truth is, being busy sometimes can be exhilarating..but really i want less stress, less rush, and more time to reflect and savor life.

And I fear that is something that our society is offering less and less.

When I was off during that period coming back, it only sucked because I was broke and a bit scared. But it was also amazing because I slept when I was tired, ate when I was hungry, and felt alive. And also i was reinventing myself.
I’m always reinventing myself, every day. but it’s hard to notice or appreciate it, because i’m so busy and stressed.

i’ve come to realize that i really do give myself negative mental instructions. not because i’m bad or because i want to, but out of habit or some sense of duty. I put myself last, and I suffer for it.

The thing I realized, and it’s really a t-shirt slogan almost, but it’s also true…

If you always put yourself last, everyone else will help you. 

it makes me chuckle, but it’s true. always putting myself first is bad. But always putting myself last is just as bad. There’s a time and place for both. That’s what I’ve been thinking about.

nothing wrong with using my umkc mail, but i didnt mean to…

I get what you’re saying and I am glad I asked. Looking forward to the new website, and hopefully seeing you do something with writing. You’ve been flirting with it for a long time.

I don’t like being too busy or not busy enough. honestly, i was pretty satisfied with my job a few months ago. I might be more so when Mary’s back and I don’t have to do all her work, too. I guess if I’m honest, I like the fact that I’m learning a lot, and that I’m challenged. I’d prefer that to how I felt in Japan..like a monkey doing tricks to entertain the troops.
But…I never get bored. Even with nothing to do, I enjoy clouds and sunshine and the breeze. And when you give me free time and the internet or books, i can stay entertained forever. So I guess if I’m honest, I’d rather work less (but maybe not at all; i find having some structure makes me more productive). if i didnt work because i was rich, i’d volunteer or go to school. or both, honestly. i’d love to just learn shit. i used to think that was what academia was, but it’s not. it’s what you described. plus having to fight a lot of jerks who are petty and jealous.

i’d love to just learn shit and do what i wanted with it. or nothing at all. i even like some research and statistical analysis, but only to the point that i don’t lose interest. my greatest strength is that i can learn just about anything and relate it; see the big picture, and see just about anyone’s vantage point and perspective…but i guess that is also my weakness. i might spend years studying something and then drop it like a hot potato (*cough* photography). That’s not bad at all. But you’re right. It’s not what an academic person would do.

Andrew,

Sure I'm still up for the t-shirt idea. I think it's a good one. 

Things are going alright here. I don't think I'll get an interview from VT honestly. I think when I took a community college job that I sealed my fate in academia so to speak.

But I also have to be honest with myself about something. I'm not an academic. That's really what my mother wanted from me, but it isn't me. I don't have the same desire to be narrowly focused as an expert with voluminous knowledge of everything ever said about any particular topic. And to be honest, to be an academic in today's world, I would have to publish in those journals and that would require a kind of in-depth and detailed research that I don't find engaging or even, honestly, valuable. 

So it's not necessarily such a bad thing that I cannot land a four-year job, except that it places me with some challenges. 

I'm zeroing in all the time on what I'd like to do, it's a difficult process though separating out, differentiating what I was supposed to want from what I do. 

Aren't you glad that you asked? 

I'm having a story of mine published, so I've been building a website as a writer for that. Other wise, things have been slow. 

I'm sorry that you're so busy, as I imagine it's not exactly awesomeness that you're busy with... but do you find it better to be busy or to have most of your time to kill... you've experienced both extremes in the last couple of years.

Alexander

I’m assuming it’s too soon to have heard from VT yet, but when does that job posting close? 

How are things, otherwise? I’m starting to think about a new website, but a more professional one with tutorials and articles and stuff that will show off my badass skills.
I’ve actually downloaded the stuff to host a full website on my Mac, and I’m working on that when I have time, which isn’t often right now. :)

Also, I’m thinking maybe we should really try to the t-shirt thing. If you’re still interested. Worst case, we’re out the small money it costs for a website and it’s a bit of experience. My problem is that I don’t have any money to play with for a couple months, and really not much time/energy. But anyway…a bit of side income would be useful.
*** Buddhism 
I reject the Catholicism of my youth, but not without some degree of respect and appreciation for what it gave me. It was very hard and courageous of me to give it up, becuase it offered me a strong sense of values and it provided a sense of meaning. I can respect people I know, family and friends, who still believe. Maybe sometimes I might even envy their certainty.

Of course, I've dabbled in agnosticism, atheism, humanism, Jungian thought, Hawaiian Huna philosophy, Daoism, Confucianism, and others...but ever since we learned about the Buddha in my World History class when I was 16, I've been really smitten with Buddhism. Like Catholicism, it provides a set of values and a sense of meaning. It also has its fluff and aspects that are somewhat questionable. But overall, I have always viewed it as the best answer for the questions that spurred my search. Not perfect, but probably the closest to a perfect worldview for me (coupled with an acceptance of ambiguity and agnosticism, of course).

But I've noticed that over the last few years...really since I took over this job about a year and a half ago, so-called 'rationalism' has taken over, for the most part. I've been more like an atheist than a Buddhist. And that's not so bad. Really, Buddhism works well as a form of atheism, because even if gods exist, they are not higher than whatever *that* might be...

But I think that in a way, I am less of a person when I don't meditate. And I'm less positive when I don't view the world in a more "Buddhist" way, whatever that really means. What attracted me to Zen, especially, was the zany and shocking mix of humor, profanity, and profundity. But what kept my attention was the fact that it really forced nothing on me but vigilance and a committment to openly and honestly trying to see life as it is.

So in that way, being 'scholarly' or 'intellectual' is the same, but it's a lot easier to fool yourself if you don't strip away the bullshit and just examine your own mind. And I also see now that I've let my body go, and that's been a huge mistake. It's not wrong to want to be strong, healthy, and attractive; not a waste to want to be happy, comfortable, or look young. It's just a mistake to think that such things will last. Nothing will last; change is the only thing that is true.

I think that is really the most useful lesson that Buddhism teaches. People make the mistake of saying that Buddhism teaches that nothing is real, or that life is meaningless. That's not true. Buddhism says that nothing has *permanence* and therefore all things change, grow, decay, and die. Science says the same. That's not to say that all of Buddhism is scientific, but I think a Zen master and a Scientist, if they are true to their goals, will try to see life and the universe as they are, and not as we would like them to be.

I'm not a master of anything. But I want to be.
*** Introspection
The good thing about introspection is that it can clear away delusions and help you see reality more clearly. Over time, it can help you become a wiser and more authentic human being.

The bad news is that it's easy to fool yourself and think you are seeing the truth, when you are actually pulling the wool over your own eyes. 

It's important to be vigilant, but having an objective and observant counterpart to call BS on the mind games and keep you focused is essential.

I'm thinking that is one of the great values of a teacher, friend, or counselor. And maybe all three are essential, at least sometimes.

What do you think?
