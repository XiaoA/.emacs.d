***** Respondus Question Types


**** Tegrity Support Guidelines
***** Obtain as much information as possible from the user, including:
- OS
- browser(s)
- the exact course site and name of the recording
- What exactly does the user see, and how far can he or she get before it "doesn't work?"



***** Tell the user, "I'm going to test the video. While I'm doing that, could you go to this site, and run the browser settings?"
***** Test the recording. *Whenever possible, test the recording, even if you are sure it is not a Tegrity outage*. This will accomplish two things:
- It will prove to the student that Tegrity is not the problem, which will make it more likely that the user will trust you and follow your instructions.
- It will ensure that there really isn't a problem with Tegrity or the Tegrity server.

Hey everyone,

We're currently working with Tegrity to figure out why users are having issues playing Tegrity though Blackboard. For now, we can have them go to http://roocasts.umkc.edu. But please make sure that you communicate the following:

- Make sure you know the OS and browser they're using, and make a note of it, or have them write that in the chat or email.
- Find out when they were last able to access Tegrity.
- Let them know that going to roocast.umkc.edu is just a temporary solution; they should be able to use Blackboard again in the future.

 Blackboard Test-taking Tips & Tricks for Students
Before the First Test
Make sure you use a Blackboard-certified or -compatible browser Browsers with these ratings have been extensively
tested to ensure that they will perform well with all of Blackboard’s critical features, including testing tools. (List of
Supported Browsers for Blackboard 9.1)
Add umkc.edu as a trusted site Make sure you add the umkc.edu domain as a trusted site in your browser’s security
settings to ensure that content won’t be blocked. If you need assistance with this, please contact the UMKC Call Center at
816-235-6700.
Disable your popup blocker for umkc.edu domain If you don’t disable your popup blocker, the test may not be able to
fully display. If you need assistance with this, please contact the UMKC Call Center at 816-235-2000.
Run through the Blackboard browser tester The Browser Test module is located near the bottom of the left-hand side
of the Blackboard login page. Click the <Run Browser Check> button to make sure your browser is optimally configured
for Blackboard.
Take the practice test If your instructor has provided a practice test, make sure that you access it at least 24 hours prior
to the start date of your first online assessment in order to provide sufficient time to fix any problems that you may
discover.
During the Test
Wait until the test loads completely Depending on your PC and internet connection speed, it may take a little while to
load a quiz, especially if the quiz is long. Make sure that, when accessing a quiz, you only click the link once. If you click a
second time, you may find yourself locked out and unable to access the test.
Carefully read all instructions Depending on your instructor’s quiz settings, students who leave the test for any reason –
for instance, to review material on another website or in another area of the Blackboard course site -- may find themselves
unable to return to complete the quiz. If the instructions for taking the quiz are not clear, please check with your instructor.
Write answers to essay questions in Word or Notepad Losing your work on an essay question you’ve put a lot of
thought and work into answering is a frustrating and heartbreaking experience! Give yourself a safety net by writing your
answers in Word or Notepad and then pasting them into the Blackboard test window. If problems should occur with test
submission, you will have a backup of your work.
Don’t double-click the <Save> or <Submit> buttons: Double-clicking may cause an error message and delay
submission of your answers. If you click <Save> or <Submit> and nothing seems to be happening, wait 60 seconds and
try again. If you get a blank page, an error message, or no confirmation that your test has been saved or submitted,
please follow the steps in the “What if Problems Occur” section below.
Be cautious with the <Backspace> key When using the <backspace> key to correct errors, make certain that your
cursor is within the text-entry field. Hitting <Backspace> when the cursor is elsewhere on the page may cause your
browser to return to the previously-displayed page and prevent you from re-accessing a test that allows a signle attempt.
Navigating through the test Do not use your browser's "Back" button, the <Backspace> key, or <ALT> + Left Arrow to
navigate to a previous page; use Blackboard's navigation tools instead.
Be cautious about resizing the test window Some browsers will refresh the screen when you resize the window. This
should not be an issue for students who are using a Blackboard-compatible browser (List of Supported Browsers for
Blackboard 9.1)
When Problems Occur
Technology is not problem-free, and it’s possible that at some point in your university career you will run into a problem
during a test, despite following all of the instructions listed above. If this happens:
Don’t touch anything Waiting a few minutes to see if the issue resolves by itself is generally a safe first step. For
example, if there is a temporary problem with the Blackboard server, the restart process takes about two minutes. If you
wait, the test will resume at the point where it left off; however, if you press buttons or attempt to reload the test page, you
will get a “Page Not Found” error and (depending on the test settings) may lose all of your test answers as well as being
blocked from re-accessing the test.
Call ITS Call Instructional Technologies at 816-235-6700. ITS staff can let you know if there are system-wide issues
affecting Blackboard, attempt to fix your problem, and advise you how to proceed. You can also use the live online chat
support by clicking the link on the Blackboard login page or at http://www.umkc.edu/ia/its.
Take a screenshot If the problem occurs after office hours, take a screenshot of your test window and any error
messages displayed. If your test answers are still visible, make certain that you get all of your answers in a screenshot. As
well as helping to identify the problem, these screenshots will also document your work on the test to the point when the
problem occurred.
Contact your instructor It’s best to open a line of communication with your instructor as soon as testing problems occur.
In a case where test responses have been lost or you are unable to re-access a test, the decision about how to proceed is
ultimately up to the instructor. Most faculty will include general information about their course policies related to online
testing in the class syllabus.

** TODO Email: Guidelines for manually-created accounts
SCHEDULED: <2013-04-23 Tue>
We never enroll  users without an SSO. If the user does not have an SSO, they will need to get one from the Call Center. Users with SSOs, who have a need for Blackboard, should be automatically enrolled. It is possible that a new user could have an SSO, but not be enrolled in Blackboard yet.

There are very few cases where we should need to create a manual account for users with an SSO. Typical scenarios include:
1. Newly-admitted students who want to take the Math Entrance Exam or another placement test
2. Instructors who have been hired, and who need access to their courses, but whose paperwork is still in progress
3. Users who have changed status, or whose status is unclear (student <--> instructor)

*The problem for us is that when we create users manually in Blackboard, these accounts do not sync with Pathway.* When we create an account manually, we need to let Mary know, so that she can flip the account to a Pathway account. If this does not happen, the user will be confused when he or she does not have access to course sites in subsequent semesters.

Mary updates user accounts in bulk when the new course sites go online, so it requires us to keep these names, so that we can report them to her later. Unfortunately, our system for keeping and reporting these names leaves a lot of opportunity for error. Mary and I have come up with a set of guidelines that should help us improve the way we handle these situations.

*** For Students
If a student has an SSO but is not enrolled in Blackboard, we shouldn't need to manually enroll them Instead, we should try to find a solution to the problem. We can ask the following questions:

- When was the student admitted?
When students have been admitted, their enrollment in Pathway will be reflected in Blackboard, and they will be able to log in to Blackboard. If a student was just admitted, and they can log in to Pathway, they might just need to wait another day or so for the system to update. The same thing applies to anyone who is changing status from faculty/staff to student.

- Which semester was the student admitted into?
If the student was admitted into a couple semesters ahead, their enrollment might not be visible in Blackboard yet.

- Why does the student need access to Blackboard?
(Can the student wait until their account is ready? If not, why?)


If you believe that a student needs an account for immediate Blackboard access, or if you believe there is an issue with their account, escalate the issue to Andrew or Mary.

*** For Instructors/Staff
If an instructor is new to the university, or has changed status from student to a faculty or staff account, the paperwork might still be in process, or their effective HR date might be a later date in the future. You can check with the Call Center to find the status of their account.

As with students, we should try to find out why their account has not been created in Blackboard. If the instructor or staff member can wait, it's better to resolve the issue (contact the Call Center; if that does not help, escalate it to Andrew or Mary). If the user has an immediate need to access Blackboard, (e.g., they are teaching a class but can't access it), give them access and keep their name (See "Keeping Track of Manual Accounts", below).

*** Keeping Track of Manual Accounts
If you do manually create an account in Blackboard, please create a new section in your OneNote, (I recommend calling it something like "ITS Call Center Log,"). Then create a new page. Call that "ITS manually-created accounts." Add any usernames that you create manually, so that we can go back and find them for Mary. She will update all of the names at once on May 1st, which is the day that all SS2013 and FS2013 courses will be made available for instructors. Each entry should include the SSO username. *Please be sure to keep the list up-to-date.*

*** Students
- Student can see enrollment in Pathway but not BB
Are you enrolled in Pathway (http://pathway.umkc.edu)? If so, then you are enrolled in the class. Please keep in mind that when you enroll in a course in Pathway, you are not automatically enrolled in Blackboard. It can take up to one business day for your course enrollment to update in Blackboard. If you have just enrolled in a class, please check again later.

For most course sites, student access is enabled one week before the start of the semester, but some instructors choose to make the course available before or after that date. If you are enrolled in Pathway, please be patient until your instructor makes the course site available. If you believe you should have access before that, please contact your instructor or the academic department directly. Our office is unable to grant you access to a course that your instructor has made unavailable.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

** Dr. Edwards
Mary and I went over to Dr. Edwards' office at Scofield Hall. She wasn't able to get the grade center to work with Firefox, but she installed Chrome and that worked. He's fine with using Chrome.
