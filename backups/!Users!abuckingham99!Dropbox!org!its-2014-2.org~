Subject: RE: History Of Healthcare Video Issue
Hi,

I'll check with Ben, but nothing has changed in Blackboard since July. More likely, there was an update to the user's computers (OS/browsers). Sorry, I'm not sure what is going on, though.

I think Mary won't be back until mid-March. I'm still trying to catch up from doing both of our jobs, but I'll check. I was starting to look at your videos at home on my Mac, but ran out of time. I'll check later, when I can.

Subject: Re: History Of Healthcare Video Issue
Thanks, Andy!! I'm not sure it is a video problem as it was all working perfectly for a month and then the first day of classes all of my videos were messed up!! Sounds more like a Bb problem to me. But, the students are being great about using the 8 step work around. I would not be so nice if I were spending 300 bucks a credit hour and had all these problems!! 
Thanks for touching base!!

Subject: Fwd: NURSE 434A 0001- Hist of Healthcare SP2014: "Assignments" not working properly--but there IS a work around!!
Ok, clear at the bottom is the work around I sent them but it is 8 steps. Since then my husband, also a HUGE nerd figured out this one:
1. Go to Assignments
2. Right click on the title
3 use the drop down menu and click on "open in new window" 
It's shorter but I have not sent it out to the students thinking we'd have it figured out by now. 
Thanks. Million, Andrew!! I hope you can leave this and get home!! I appreciate your help and knowing you are the "new Mary" more than I can tell you!! 
I am NOT a nerd so I am little help in problem solving!! 
Take care and KNOW I appreciate your help!! Judy

The outcome of this change means you cannot just go in and clinck on the title and the video pops up.  At least that's how it is NOT working for me and two students that are having the same problem.  If you are not working on this class you don't know what I'm talking about and WHEN they get it fixed, it will be back to the normal, user-friendly state.  However, IF you want to get some work done and access videos for now here is a work around.

I'm unable to confirm the log rotations due to that function being a blackboard application controlled task.  I'd recommend a case with Blackboard to sanity check the status of "all" the application tasks.  i.e. a health check of tasks in general on each node.  (In the past, if not mistaken, there was a bbtasks.xml that was unique to each server... It has been a very long time since I've been in the tasks arena).  Columbia's Bb admins became frustrated enough with application controlled tasks that they added an entry to the bbuser’s crontab due to the inconsistency from the application layer.  Let me know if a recipe is needed or if the team needs assistance with this. 

As to the systems:

If not mistaken nightly restarts could be potential causes of tasks failing (thus the restart staggering as seen below).  The Bb admins in Columbia have modified the restart schedule to weekly vs daily or every two day restarts.   They conducted this schedule change after heavy java tuning which had great benefit to overall system performance.  That said, current service restarts and log rotations are as follows:

Kcbbapp1 service restart at 3:25 a.m. on mon, wed, fri, sun

Kcbbapp2 service restart at 3:15 a.m. on tue, thurs, sat

Kcbbapp3 service restart at 3:15 a.m. on mon, wed, fri, sun

Kcbbapp4 service restart at 3:25 a.m. on tues, thrs, sat


So servers are being restarted nightly in a staggered mechanism.  Let me know if the team needs more info or how we can help.  (An entry of the logrotate task into bbuser crontab would be valid if Blackboard is unable to answer why the tasks are not firing.)

 

Hope this helps,

George

George,


Can you confirm we have a scheduled tasks to auto-rotate the log on each server nightly?  That is what I have been told is in place.  Something like bbapp1 at 1:00 AM, bbapp2 at 1:30 AM, bbapp3 at 2:00 pm.  Can you also let us know what that schedule is for each server?

 

Also, are the servers being restarted nightly?  If I can get that answer and schedule also it would be helpful.

 

Thanks,

Hi, George.

I'm filling in for Mary, but that's in addition to my main duties as the Call Center Manager for ITS at UMKC. I was extremely busy on Tuesday; especially since we were a bit understaffed that day. I thought I was doing the right thing by alerting you to a potential problem, rather than wait for it to become a fiasco.

I generally try to figure out how to do Mary's tasks myself, because I don't want to bother anyone, and I like to learn things myself. But on that day, I was swamped in the call center, and the instructions I had for rotating the logs were either outdated or just incorrect. I could barely handle the calls, chats, and emails we had, without worrying that we might be having a problem with some/all of our users being unable to log in. I don't want to contact you for something that you don't support, but I tend to think of you first, because you've been so helpful in the past.

Mary told me before to only log in to kcbbapp3. I think that before I was able to rotate the logs from there (has that changed since November?). Or maybe not. After I got your email, when I had more time, I decided to try logging on to kcbbapp1 and saw that I could rotate the logs there. So I figured it out myself. I've been monitoring the servers, and they're running at acceptable levels now.

My understanding was that you guys are responsible for supporting us if we have issues with the server, but I'll clarify that with Andy Goodenow. Anyway, now that I know that I need to log on to kcbbapp1, I'll be able to handle that one myself.

To answer your question, I get the Bunyanesque emails, but I don't think I get the Zabbix alerts. Whom do I contact for that? (BTW, is there *anything else* that Mary has access to that I still don't?)

Thanks,

Also..  watch disk usage.  

 

Kcbbapp4 was critical (we were paged).  I took the liberty of becoming bbuser and runign the logrotate.sh script (as bbuser).

 

kcbbpp1 is running hot and I’d recommend the KC team become bbuser and run the logrotate script.

 

Linux team is a bit out of scope becoming the bbuser unless we are directed to do so by your team.  Zabbix should be sending alerts for action.  Let us know if you are not receiving the notices that disks are becoming full.

Some of us on BBApp1 on blackboard.umkc.edu noticed a spike in cpu resources on server 1, and it was very slow to load. It seems like it's better. By the time I was able to report this, it appeared to be better, but I'll send this just in case it's helpful.

Subject: EHCache Settings

As mentioned on the LTIC Tech call this morning, I’m attaching the EHCache setting suggestions BB Support gave to Karin at SLU.  I implemented them here last week and saw about a 30% performance boost.  Our average response time went from 250ms to 180ms.

 

As always, try this on Dev first!  Also, note that there can be no trailing spaces on a config line.  Tomcat/Ehcache reads everything from the = sign to the end of line.  A trailing space can completely break that cache and kill performance.  (Yeah, don’t ask how I know that or figured out the cause.  Just learn from my mistake!  ;-)

Subject: DB hardware refresh and LTIC call.

Hi All-

 

Getting this down while its fresh on everyone’s mind and to have more eyes on the plan.

 

In this a.m.’s LTIC call we developed a great plan to get out of the expiring physical database hardware.  The plan will upgrade everyone’s Bb instance to the latest RHEL OS on both application and database nodes and the latest supported Oracle on the database hardware.  This plan also eliminates the old “ball and chain” of physical hardware.

 

Requested, let me know if there are errors, order is ( STL || COL / KC / MS&T ) of course awaiting approval and success from testing an sizing metrics as STL and COL make progress.

 

Here is the generic procedure:

1)      Build a fresh RHEL with latest Oracle database VM.

2)      Refresh Prod database into new database VM.

3)      Refresh the Prod data (/usr/local/blackboard/content/*) into Dev

4)      Verify Development instance is fully functional

5)      Install latest Bb with patches

6)      Verify, Test, and analyze performance.

7)      Add net new single app node that is latest RHEL with latest Bb

8)      Rotate new app node in.

9)      Rotate out old app node.

10)   Repeat 7-9 until no old app nodes remain.

11)   Verify, Test, and analyze performance.

 

Risks….

 

We are at the skin of our teeth on warranty levels on hardware.  Here are our assumptions if the worst happened for the physical hardware after warranty expiration:

 

1)      We’d be able to invoke DR procedures and flip over to the Oracle data guard.

2)      While in data guard mode, build out a new virtual database machine and restore from dd890 backup.

3)      Assume that physical hardware is no longer an option.

4)      Updates (OS, DB, etc…) will stay within fully certified, blessed, and approved Blackboard support matrix.

 

 

Of course we want to hear all feedback and we need to know if the team perceives too much risk.

 

Thanks again,

 

George

Not quite.  I was wondering if you were going to ask Columbia to reclone the database or not.  If not, then I can do what I need.  If Columbia was, then I would hold off until that portion was done.  I just wasn’t sure if Columbia was going to wipe out the DEV database or not.  Maybe they won’t.  Just don’t know.

Hi Andrew,
Making small talk at an orientation meeting last week, another adjunct recommended your online tech support for Blackboard as one of the best things at UMKC. I completely agreed. She and I are both experienced with the LMS tech support at other colleges. 
You kindly agreed to send a copy of your presentation. I am particularly interested in your examples of course set-ups. I would like to re-organize my class around learning modules this semester. 
1.  Do you have examples of courses organized around Lessons, e.g., topics with their own learning objectives? Would you be able to share one with me?  It looked like you had a shell of one in your presentation. 
2. Also, may I please have a sandbox course so work this out on?
Thank you again. You and your staff are essential to the quality of education at UMKC.
