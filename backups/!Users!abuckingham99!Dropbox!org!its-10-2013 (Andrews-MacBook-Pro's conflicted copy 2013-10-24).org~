***** Respondus Question Types


**** Tegrity Support Guidelines
***** Obtain as much information as possible from the user, including:
- OS
- browser(s)
- the exact course site and name of the recording
- What exactly does the user see, and how far can he or she get before it "doesn't work?"



***** Tell the user, "I'm going to test the video. While I'm doing that, could you go to this site, and run the browser settings?"
***** Test the recording. *Whenever possible, test the recording, even if you are sure it is not a Tegrity outage*. This will accomplish two things:
- It will prove to the student that Tegrity is not the problem, which will make it more likely that the user will trust you and follow your instructions.
- It will ensure that there really isn't a problem with Tegrity or the Tegrity server.

(Final is a bit different)

Hello, Professor.

I'm sorry to hear about your frustrations with your online course. I share your desire to improve the way our office supports the UMKC community. Please feel free to address any questions or concerns you have directly to me, rather than to our part-time staff, as I am the supervisor of the the ITS Call Center.

I was a bit surprised by what you wrote, because it seems to imply that our office has not help you in two weeks, and that I used our staffing levels as an excuse. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe that is a fair assessment of the situation. There is a difference between saying that you've contacted us to help resolved more than one issue over the course of two weeks, while you have been working on the project of setting up your test, and saying that you've been waiting for us to resolve the same issue for two weeks.

I don't remember the context of why I told you we were short of staff, but I don't think it has caused unreasonable delays in our turnaround time. I haven't worked with you every time you've contacted us, but I did speak with you last Friday. Your students were uploading videos, in various formats. You were having problems viewing some of them, and your students were unable to upload any more. I informed you that your course quota was almost at its limit, and suggested a couple of other options. I even created a custom PDF, detailing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach; I recommended Tegrity as the best solution, and provided detailed instructions on how to set that up for you and your students. I even stayed late working on that, to make sure you had that for the weekend.

You spoke with Natalie on 10/1, because you were having problems with Tegrity. Unfortunately, she referred you to Ben instead of Ali, because she is new, and she made a mistake. I apologize for the inconvenience. I have told her how to handle similar issues in the future.

There is one thing I'd like to suggest, so that we can provide faster and more efficient service. When you've contacted our office, we've had trouble understanding the exact nature of your issue. For example, looking over this email thread, you reported that you "could not access Tegrity." From our perspective, that could point to many issues, including: computer/browser issues, network issues, or issues related to the location or permissions of your Tegrity recordings. When you contact our office, please be sure to give us enough details of the exact nature of your isesue, as well as how we can test or reproduce the issue ourselves. For example, if we receive a report that says, "I can't access Tegrity," it will take us time to determine the nature of your issue, and you may experience delays. However, if you were to say, "I went into my course site, but I can't find the 'Tegrity classes' link in my course menu," we could immediately escalate that issue to our Tegrity specialist, as only he can resolve that issue.

Now that he has helped you restore the missing 'Tegrity Classes' links, I hope that your video assessment is working well, and that we have fully resolved all of your issues with Blackboard/Tegrity. Please let me know if there is anything further that we can do to help you.

Regularly Recurring Blackboard Tasks

1.       Create a ‘Final Grade’ column (this is the column that allows faculty to pull grades into Pathway) in each of the semester’s course sites.

Typically done early to mid-semester. Uses the addfinalgrade DB procedure.

2.       Clean up the ‘Users’ table. Steps are: (1) Identifying non-privileged, non-system-required accounts that have existed for at least one year and either have never had a login or the last login was > 1 year ago; (2) Disabling and setting the DSK of these accounts to umkc.to.be.deleted; (3) Giving ITS folks a chance to object to any deletions and doing an eyeball check of the accounts to be killed; and (4) Doing a DSM purge on the disabled accounts.

Typically done once in late summer and one over winter break.

3.       “Flip semester” for students. Steps are: (1) Inform instructors ahead of time about the availability switch; (2) Help Desk collects exception requests from faculty; (3) Make upcoming term course sites available to students (unless an exception request has been made); (4) Disable student enrollment in previous term’s course sites.

Typically done one week before start of classes for new semester.

4.       “Flip semester” for faculty. Steps: (1) Generate list of emails for users with a role of ‘P’ in previous term’s sites. (2) Update LML Blackboard-Announce with this list. (3) Send email warning users that access to previous term’s sites will be pulled approximately 30 days into the next semester, instructions for self-archive, etc. Same info should also be posted in a Bb announcement available to UMKC-FACULTY role, listed in Jing’s newsletter, etc. (4) Handle exceptions for ongoing sites, etc. (5) Change row_status and DSK to ‘2’ in course_users for folks with role of ‘P’ in a site where crsmain_pk1 belongs to a previous term course site.

Typically completed 30 days into the subsequent semester. Warning notices need to go out earlier.

5.       Archive sites. Steps: (1) Get DSK of sites to be archived (2) Get count of sites with that DSK (3) Generate list of course IDs (4) Create a folder for the archives in app3 /DEV_Caution (5) Create input file in /usr/local/blackboard/apps/content-exchange/bin. Each line should consist of <site id>,<destination folder>, e.g. UMKC-COMP-SCI5599-0002-34944-SS2013,/DEV_Caution/SS2013_Archives/ (6) Run archive script ($ ./batch_ImportExport.sh -f YourInputFile.txt -l 1 -t archive) (7) When finished, verify count. (8) FTP archives to permanent storage (8) Delete archives from /DEV_Archives.

Typically done some time after completion of the term in order to catch late changes.

6.       Purge sites. Steps: (1) Archive the sites as above (2) Make exception list of sites with size > 250 Mb (2.5) Tell Duane you are about to remove the sites so that he can add data to table used by BBUR search tool  (3) Change DSK of remaining sites to 186/umkc.to.be.deleted. (4) Use DSM tools to count, count_disabled, purge sites with that DSK.

Typically done 1 year + 1 month after close of semester in order to facilitate course copying for Help Desk, i.e. FS2012 sites would be purged a month into FS2013.

7.       Set up site creation, enrollment, active, etc. dates for upcoming semesters. Summer and  Fall should be done together. Use web tool at https://kc-csrv-ora4.kc.umkc.edu/oracle-Login.html to fix dates.

Typically done several months before start of the semester.

8.       As needed: update/install extensions & building blocks; patch; purge old logs and other files to maintain sufficient free space on app servers; etc.

 

9.       Gradebook export from previous semester. Typically done immediately prior to flipping semester for students.
