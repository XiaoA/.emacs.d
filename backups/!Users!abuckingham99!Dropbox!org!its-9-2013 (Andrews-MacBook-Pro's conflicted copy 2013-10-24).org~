***** Respondus Question Types


**** Tegrity Support Guidelines
***** Obtain as much information as possible from the user, including:
- OS
- browser(s)
- the exact course site and name of the recording
- What exactly does the user see, and how far can he or she get before it "doesn't work?"



***** Tell the user, "I'm going to test the video. While I'm doing that, could you go to this site, and run the browser settings?"
***** Test the recording. *Whenever possible, test the recording, even if you are sure it is not a Tegrity outage*. This will accomplish two things:
- It will prove to the student that Tegrity is not the problem, which will make it more likely that the user will trust you and follow your instructions.
- It will ensure that there really isn't a problem with Tegrity or the Tegrity server.

** September 2013 Monthly Report
*** Projects and Areas of Responsibility

1. *Documentation and User Training*

   - *Website*: Updated "Blackboard Test - Taking Tips & Tricks for Students" (http://www.umkc.edu/ia/it/blackboard/documents/students/Taking%20Tests/assess_tips.pdf).

   - *OneNote*: I created or edited 18 OneNote pages.

   - *User Training*

     + Teresa Torres 9/24: Respondus 4.0/Uploading a test

2. *Staff Training and Development*

   - *Staff Meetings*:

     - Every month, I meet with each staff member individually. No one
       had any major problems to report this time.

   - *Other*

   - *Staff Hiring*

     + We hired Natalie Bradshaw in August, but there were problems with the HR/Payroll process. She started on 9/19.

     + We hired Erik Schneider. Hopefully, he will be starting soon.

     + I set up a new MS Access database *(N:\Groups\IA\ITS\Andrew\Database\ITS_Applicants)* to track ITS Student Assistant applicants. We've had a huge increase in the number of student applicants, and we needed a way to easily track applicants and send mail merge emails for successful/unsucessful applications. I've trained James Leftwich on how to enter data, and will be training the others so that they can add/remove records and run a few simple queries..

3. *UMKC Blackboard Team*
   - Monthly Meeting: Friday, 9/6/2013, Cockefair Hall
   - I've continued to keep daily records of the Snapshot run times. I also started to keep our data source files, just in case we need them.


*** Challenges
- As of 10/1, I still did not have access to the database. I followed all of Nathan's instructions, and spent time looking online for a solution. In the end, it turned out that I didn't have the correct username/password. (I got those when I visited Nathan's office on 10/3).

*** Goals
- Three workshops in October
- Prepare a set of the most useful SQL queries, links, and information I'll need to cover for Mary.
- Oversee Erik's training

Hello, Tusha.

To request an organization site on Blackboard, you don't have to contact the Registrar's office. Our office can take care of that for you. Normally, to do that, you would need to use the Request System to make the request. Here are instructions for doing that: 

After we've created the organization site, you can send us an Excel file with the first names, last names, and usernames of the users you'd like enrolled, as well as their roles. 

This is something I've done for Rion in the past, so I can take of this on your behalf this time. We'll contact you when your oganization site is ready. It's also possible to copy materials from previous course sites. Let us know if you're interested in doing that.

*** DONE (Check the iMac) Find out about The Grade Center on Macs and Chrome/Firefox
CLOSED: [2013-09-28 Sat 10:59] SCHEDULED: <2013-09-25 Wed>
for Mark Brodwin 2508. On Chrome, he doesn't see the scroll bars in Chrome on his Mac.

*Issue:* On OSX 10.7, some browsers do now allow users to scroll vertically or horizontally (Firefox 23 and earlier do, but the latest version of 24, which was just released, also has this problem). 

*Here's what I've found:*

- On OSX 10.8 (the latest version), all browsers work with the Grade Center correctly. But I don't recommend updating to 10.8 now, as OSX 10.9 should be released sometime in October.
- On OSX 10.7, I tested the latest version of Safari, Webkit, Firefox, Google Chrome, and OmniWeb. The only browsers that work properly are Firefox 23 and OmniWeb. Yesterday, my Firefox automatically updated me to Firefox 24, and the scrollbars have now disappeared.

*If you're using OSX 10.7.5 or earlier, you have some choices:*

1. Immediately update to 10.8 (I'd recommend waiting).
2. It's possible to revert to an older version of Firefox (scrollbars worked perfectly on Version 23). See this page for more information: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-older-version-of-firefox or download version 23 (the previous version) here: https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/releases/23.0.1/mac/en-US/Firefox%2023.0.1.dmg
3. OmniWeb (a free browser from the makers of famous Mac software like OmniFocus and OmniOutliner) is an excellent browser, and the current version works fine with scrollbars. You can download that here: http://www.omnigroup.com/more
4. Use Windows on your Mac, on a different computer, or via Remote Desktop: http://www.umkc.edu/is/support/services/homecomputing/remotedesktop/mac/

*I'd recommend Option 3 (download OmniWeb). It's an excellent browser, and it's easy to download and use it for Blackboard.* These days, it's not as popular as it used to be, but it has been around for a long time, works well. Or you can try option 2 (reverting to Firefox 23).

This is a temporary issue, limited to users of 10.7 (and possibly 10.6 or earlier; I don't have a version to test). Future updates to Safari, Firefox, or Chrome might fix this problem with OSX. I'll bet Firefox will fix this issue very quickly with an update. OSX 10.9 will be released, and it should work there, as well. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.
