Rob Sobers, author of the excellent book, [Learn Ruby the Hard Way][learnruby], outlines some very interesting discoveries about Ruby blocks:

>Here was the major realization I had about blocks: without understanding the inner-workings of the method I’m passing a block to, I can’t really write my block.

>I couldn’t treat it as a black box, as badly as I wanted to. With many methods (or APIs), I can simply pass in arguments and get a return value without ever having to understand what actually goes on inside. And that encapsulation is a beautiful thing.

>But with blocks, I am actively participating in writing the method I’m calling, so I have to understand the context in which my code is called. I also have to understand the objects that are yielded to my block via its arguments.
