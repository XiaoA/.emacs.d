* My cultural identity

I appear to be a typical white American male, of mixed European ancestry. My wife is Chinese, and I lived, worked, and studied in Japan for over seven years. While I was in Asia, most people viewed me as an American. But for me, the question of my cultural identity has become increasingly clouded over the years.

Most people probably believe that if you are a member of a particular nationality of ethnic group, then you are a member of that culture. In traditional cultures, where travel and exposure to other groups is limited, we still see a more tightly-knit sense of cultural norms and behavior. But I have lived in a multilingual, multicultural environment for so long, that my concept of culture is highly individualized and fluid; my thinking, language, and behavior patterns change, depending on the situation. For example, in my home, we communicate in three languages interchangeably, with no set rules or limitations. I could say "water," "Shui," or "mizu" and my wife would understand. This makes it hard for me to identify with most of my friends and family, who have never left the country, or learned another language to a high level of proficiency.

Perhaps the problem is that my life experiences seem to be at odds with my most of the people I know. Samovar, Porter, and McDaniel offer a clue to my "What makes culture so unique is that you share you culture with other people who have been exposed to similar experiences (22)."


What if our cultural identity is like the rules of a game, which limit our language, movement, and thinking in order to allow us to play? Once the game is over, we are no longer bound by the limits of the game...

I believe that my cultural identity changes, depending on my environment, much like quantum physics.

Successful intercultural communication requires empathy, flexibility, and humor. (It also requires fast thinking.)

I am a white American male, of mixed European ancestry. But that is not my cultural identity.

I find it hard to identify myself with a particular culture, because my sense of culture and belonging are constantly changing. Just over six months ago, I was staying in China, with my wife's family, watching Chinese dramas and cursing the constant onslaught of fireworks celebrating Chinese New Year. Before that, I spent over seven years in Japan, teaching English, translating, and studying. While I never felt fully integrated in either Chinese or Japanese societies, I felt varying levels of integration with those cultures.

I believe that when people fail to truly listen to each other, they limit their ability to understand each other. Today, modern societies are becoming more complex and hetrogenous. As a member of this emerging cultural group, I believe that effective intercultural communiction requires people to move beyond old ways of thinking about culture and communication.

Bird and ??? argue that the members of the /emergent culture/ speak the same language, eat the same food, and wear the same clothes; their lifestyle and thinking are all but indistinguishable.

While this may be true of a relatively small subset of internationally-minded people,
