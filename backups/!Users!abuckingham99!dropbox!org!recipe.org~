* Cherry-Stuffed French Toast

** Ingredients
- 1 lb French or Italian bread, unsliced
- 1/3 cup heavy cream
- 1 cup fresh sweet cherries, pitted
- 1 tablespoon oil, for griddle
- 6 whole eggs, well beaten
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon confectioners sugar
- 1 cup reduced-fat cream cheese
- 2 cups pure maple syrup

** Preparation
Slice the bread into 1-1/2-inch slices. Cut each slice lengthwise
three-quarters of the way down, so that you have almost formed two
slices of bread (the 1/4 inch at the bottom will hold the entire piece
together). Set aside.

Using an electric mixer at medium speed, combine the cream cheese,
heavy cream, and cherries.

Spread approximately 1/4 cup of the mixture into the pocket of each
slice of bread. Gently press the two sides together, distributing the
filling evenly.

Lightly oil a griddle and heat until hot but not smoking. Dip each
slice of the stuffed bread into the beaten egg to coat all
sides. Place the bread on the griddle, sprinkle with cinnamon, and
turn when golden brown; continue cooking until the second side is
brown.

Remove the cooked slices to a cutting board and gently slice each
piece in half diagonally. Garnish with confectioners' sugar. Arrange
the triangles on warmed individual serving plates and serve
immediately with hot maple syrup.

cranberries. Pour over the cubed bread and lightly toss. Pour the
mixture into the baking dish and bake for 30 minutes.

* Overnight Cinnamon Rolls                                        :breakfast:
From Alton Brown, FoodNetwork.com

** Ingredients:
*** For the dough:
- 2 large egg yolks, at room temperature
- 1 large whole egg, at room temperature
- ¼ cup sugar
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 6 ounces buttermilk, at room temperature
- 4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
- 1 package instant dry yeast, about 2 ¼ teaspoons
- 1 ¼ teaspoons kosher salt
- canola oil or cooking spray

*** For the filling
- 1 cup packed light brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon cinnamon
- pinch of salt
- 1 ½ tablespoons melted unsalted butter

*** For the icing
- ¼ cup cream cheese, softened
- 2 tablespoons milk
- 1 ½ cups confectioners’ sugar

** Preparation

- In the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whisk the egg yolks, whole egg, sugar, butter and buttermilk.

- Add 2 cups of flour, yeast and salt; whisk until moistened and combined.

- Replace the whisk attachment with a dough hook.

- Add all but 3/4 cup of the remaining flour, and knead on low speed for 5 minutes.

- Check the consistency of the dough; it should feel soft and moist but not sticky (add more flour if needed).

- Knead on low speed 5 minutes more or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl.

- Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and knead by hand for about 30 seconds.

- Lightly oil a large bowl.

- Transfer the dough to the bowl, lightly oil the top of the dough, cover and let double in volume, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.

- Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in bowl. Mix well, then set aside.

- Butter a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and shape it into a rectangle with the long side nearest you. Roll into an 18-by-12-inch rectangle. Brush the dough with the melted butter, leaving 1/2-inch border along the top edge. Sprinkle the filling mixture over the dough (leaving a 3/4-inch border along the top edge), and gently press the filling into the dough. Beginning with the long edge nearest you, roll the dough into a tight cylinder. Pinch the seam to seal, and roll the cylinder seam side down. Very gently squeeze the cylinder to create even thickness. Using a serrated knife, slice the cylinder into 1 1/2-inch rolls (12 rolls total). Arrange rolls cut-side down in the baking dish, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and store in the refrigerator overnight or up to 16 hours.

- Remove rolls from the refrigerator, and place in an oven (turned off). Fill a shallow pan 2/3-full with boiling water, and set on the rack below the rolls. Close the oven door, and let the rolls rise until they look slightly puffy, about 30 minutes. Remove the rolls and the shallow pan of water from the oven. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

- When the oven is ready, place the rolls on the middle rack, and bake until golden brown, about 30 minutes. While the rolls are cooling slightly, make the icing by whisking the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer until creamy. Add the milk, and whisk until combined. Sift in the powdered sugar, and whisk until smooth. Spread over the rolls, and serve immediately.

"Potatoes, celery, onion and garlic are sauteed in bacon drippings in this tarragon and cilantro scented soup which is thickened with heavy cream."
INGREDIENTS:
1 pound bacon, chopped
2 stalks celery, diced
1 onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
8 potatoes, peeled and cubed
4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover
potatoes
3 tablespoons butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup heavy cream
1 teaspoon dried tarragon
3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro
salt and pepper to taste
DIRECTIONS:
1. In a Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until done. Remove bacon from pan, and set aside. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.
2. In the bacon grease remaining in the pan, saute the celery and onion until onion begins to turn clear. Add the garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Return the bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender.
3. In a separate pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour. Cook stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the heavy cream, tarragon and cilantro. Bring the cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Stir the cream mixture into the potato mixture. Puree about 1/2 the soup, and return to the pan. Adjust seasonings to taste.
