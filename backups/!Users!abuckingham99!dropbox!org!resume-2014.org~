* Education
*** 2011 - 2013 (Expected)
    *M.A. Education, Curriculum and Instruction*
*University of Missouri - Kansas City*
*** December 1999
    *B.A. Interdisciplinary - Asian/Pacific Rim Studies
* Work Experience
*** July 2009 - /Present/
    *Research Associate*, [[http://fossee.in][FOSSEE]], IIT-Bombay

    My work in this team involves design and development of learning
    material for, and training of teachers and students in the area of
    Python for Scientific Computing.  I have been involved in
    development of the course material for an introductory course on
    Software Tools, Techniques and Practices for Scientists and
    Engineers, which is going to be delivered at various places
    including IIT-B, beginning next semester.  I have also ported some
    Control Engineering code from MATLAB to Python.  I have also been
    involved in the initial set-up \& maintenance of the server.
*** Jan - Jun, 2009
    *Intern*, STMicroelectronics India Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore

    Developed a new sub-system for automated testing of a few of the
    processes, for testing the software on a DigitalTV Chip.  The
    sub-system abstracts out the actual function calls for the tests,
    and allows the tests to be conducted by anybody.  This system
    provides a scope for future automation of the testing process.

*** May - Jul 2007
    *Summer Intern*, National Physical Laboratory, New Delhi

    Fabricated transparent nano-structured transparent ZnO thin films,
    doped with MnO, using the Sol-Gel spin coating process.  Also
    carried out characterization of the films using various techniques
    like TEM, SEM, X-Ray diffraction and film stress measurement.
* Academic Projects
*** Aug - Dec, 2008
    *Designing a room status manager*

    Designed and developed a room status manager that keeps track of,
    and shows whether the room is occupied or not. Visitors may choose
    to leave messages, that can be viewed later.  It was designed as a
    part of a course on Embedded System Design.  It involved
    interfacing an LCD and a keypad to an 8051 and coding in assembly.

*** Aug - Dec, 2008
    *Study of phase transitions in mechanical models*

    The project involved the study, observation of the phases and
    plotting the phase transitions in a simple mechanical model using
    MATLAB as a tool. A simple model of a sphere rolling down the
    surface of another sphere was considered and the phase transitions
    between the pure rolling, rolling with slipping and detached
    phases were studied.
***** Mentor
      Dr. A.K. Biswas, Physics, BITS-Pilani, Goa Campus
*** Aug - Dec, 2007
    *Simulation of class room acoustics*

    The project involved simulation of class-room acoustics using the
    method of images, in general, and the Allen-Berkeley algorithm in
    particular, to obtain the reverberation time profile of a cuboid
    shaped classroom and to identify the `acoustically' best
    locations. MATLAB was used to write and simulate the code.

* Other Projects
*** Emacs Org-mode
    I am an active contributor to Org-mode which is an Emacs package
    for keeping notes, maintaining ToDo lists, project planning, and
    authoring with a fast and effective plain-text system.

    Apart from patches directly to Org-mode, I have made some
    contributions to the "eco-system" of org-mode. \\

    - org2blog :: An org-mode based client, that can be used to post
                  directly to Wordpress blogs from within Org-mode.
    - Pandoc :: Pandoc is a swiss-army knife, to convert files from
                one markup format into another. I added org-mode as
                one of the output formats to it.
    - org-ghi :: Org-mode can be used to keep ToDo lists; and each bug
                 or issue in your code, can be considered a ToDo
                 item. org-ghi provides an interface between GitHub
                 Issues and Org-mode.
    - gollum :: Gollum is the git-powered wiki system that is used in
                every GitHub Wiki. I have added org-mode support for
                the visual editor of gollum.
*** GetHub
    GetHub is a Chrome extension that displays desktop notifications
    for new updates in your Github NewsFeed.
* Technical Skills
*** Languages & Libraries
    - Proficient :: Python (Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib), Emacs Lisp,
                    Matlab, C, Bash, HTML, Javascript, CSS
    - Learning :: Haskell, C++, OpenCV, CMU Sphinx
*** Authoring
    - Text :: Org-mode, LaTeX, reStructured Text, Emacs
    - Graphics :: Gimp, Inkscape
*** Version Control
    Git, Mercurial
*** Sys Admin
    Good experience with system administration on Debian based systems
    and Bash scripting.
*** Course Design
    Course design and Content development based on instructional
    design principles.
