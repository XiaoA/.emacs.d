**** My Question
     What would you most like to learn?
     
     Every educator has her or her own approach to education, and we all have our own strengths and weaknesses. I think it's interesting to learn new approaches and skills from colleagues.  What aspects of instruction (e.g., curriculum development, assessment, pacing, classrom control, etc.) would you like to learn or improve during this course?
**** Ayman Refaat
content-based instruction (CBI)

When do you think teachers can use content-based instruction (CBI) as classroom practices for second language learner instruction? Students in the beginning level might not know the English Alphabet either one English word. so, teachers need to start with language-based instruction (LBI), but until which level?

     Hello, Ayman.

     That's an interesting question. First, I think that it's possible to teach content-based language skills right from the beginning, even if the students don't know the alphabet or any words. I taught for seven years in Japan, and I taught a lot of "false beginners" but I also taught true beginners, like children, who couldn't use any English. Depending on the content and/or learning objectives, it's definitely possible. Learning letters and vocabulary is certainly important, and a core component of reading and writing classes, but more "practical" lessons can help motivate and improve students right from the beginning.

     Here's a simple example. How do you teach your children how to behave in the classroom? Right from the beginning, students of all ages can learn about the objects in the classroom, how to ask for help, or how to receive permission to do things. They don't need to know how to spell "chair" or "sit down" to understand what you mean when you say these words. Finding content that is both useful and interesting for students will help them learn, and it will make it easier to weather difficult grammar lessons. What kind of situations will your students find themselves in? What if you taught them how to understand a song or a phrase on TV, just for fun? Speaking as someone who's also learned a few languages, I always wanted to learn some "impractical, but fun" language, right from the beginning. It motivated me, and it disarmed others, and made them laugh. Being able to use Medieval Japanese Samarai expressions is not practical for doing business in Tokyo, but it sure made me and my friends laugh a lot!

     Now, we're focusing in this course more on ESL learning. But when I was in Japan, I often taught students who needed to pass an interview to become a flight attendant, or to go to an international business dinner meeting. These students *required* content-based instruction, even when they could barely speak more than a few words of English. I often used to Total Physical Response to teach learners of all ages how to perform daily tasks, engage in simple conversations, and even build critical and creating thinking skills in English. Learning can be difficult, and it can be discouraging. I think that finding ways to promote both practical and fun curriculum into a course makes all the difference in the world. To be truly effective, I think learning should be meaningful and varied. Ideally, it should be fun, but it should always take your students' needs into account. I think, in almost all cases, they need content right from the beginning!
