** Reflection Paper 1
*** Identify your culture and discuss the types of communication problems that have occurred when you have interacted with people from cultures different from your own. Explain how these difficulties have made you feel.

I appear to be a typical white American male, of mixed European ancestry. My wife is Chinese, and I lived, worked, and studied in Japan for over seven years. While I was in Asia, most people viewed me as an American. But for me, the question of my cultural identity has become increasingly clouded over the years.

Identifying culture with nationality In traditional cultures, where travel and exposure to other groups is limited, we still see a more tightly-knit sense of cultural norms and behavior. But I have lived in a multilingual, multicultural environment for so long, that my concept of culture is highly individualized and fluid; my thinking, language, and behavior patterns change, depending on the situation. For example, in my home, we communicate in three languages interchangeably, with no set rules or limitations. I could say "water," "Shui," or "mizu" and my wife would understand. This makes it hard for me to identify with most of my friends and family, who have never left the country, or learned another language to a high level of proficiency.

Perhaps the problem is that my life experiences seem to be at odds with my most of the people I know. Samovar, Porter, and McDaniel offer a clue to my "What makes culture so unique is that you share you culture with other people who have been exposed to similar experiences (22)."

I have been drawn to people from other cultures for as long as I can remember. From my earliest days in grade school, I enjoyed making friend with people from Japan, Vietnam, India, and other countries. In high school, I was a member of a group called Multicultural Youth Together. Our purpose was to build awareness and appreciation of cultural diversity. As an undergrad at UMKC, I majored in Asian Studies, and I was the Vice-President and President of the Japanese Student Organization. 

Spending so much time abroad, I have had many communication problems. I had studied Japanese and Chinese before I lived in Asia, so I could communicate fairly well. But I did have language problems. So much of language is tied to pop culture references, and idiomatic expressions that are almost impossible to understand without a strong grounding in the current events, Television, movies, books, and media of a particular

Andrew,

This is a thoughtful and really interesting piece of writing you have done here.  I appreciate your strong effort and the time you have taken to research and cite other sources.  Your experience and interest in cultural questions is apparent and stimulating.  

I appreciate that you have written about specific instances that you have experienced.  This helps to bring your paper alive.  You have written quite a lot but it has been on the topic. 

Your observation about some of what can be construed as out-of-line observations of our authors is well-taken, I believe.  We seem to walk this tight rope of, on the one hand, recognizing differences but, on the other hand, of being wrong in some instances when we try to do so even if were are very sensitive.  

One note on style--a lengthy quote per APA style should be single spaced, not double spaced, as I recall.

I look forward to reading more of your work.  (I can see why you wrote so much but don't be reluctant to compress and winnow down to the most important points.)

Hi Chia-Hua,

Although I did not understand what you refer with the functions of communication, I personally prefer face to face communication rather than learning from other resources. And I strongly believe that in today's world we need this face to face communication more than ever before. As we all know that most of our opinions and thoughts about other cultures and nations are shaped by the mass media such as TV, newspaper, radio and so forth, and unfortunately many people are having prejudices against those cultures without personally seeing or getting to know them, and it is becoming really hard to change those stereotypes and prejudges and it sometimes takes lots of time to change them.
Thank you for asking this question!

***** My reply

I agree with Murat that face to face communication is very important, but for me, it really depends on the subject matter, and my mood. For example, if I want to learn how to use a piece of software, sometimes I might just look for a screencast on Vimeo or YouTube. Other times, I might want to read the manual, or even just try it out and learn as I go. But there definitely times when it is helpful to have someone there to help, too.

I used to love to chat on the phone, and I still do sometimes, but I find myself becoming increasingly annoyed with long phone conversations, and I would prefer either face to face communication, or the ability to reply via email, at my convenience. I carry on long, drawn-out discussions with some of my friends via email, and it works out well, because we can take our time and reply when we want.

Regarding Chia-Hua's question, the text lists four main functions of communication:

1. Communication allows you to gather information about other people
2. Communication helps fulfill interpersonal needs
3. Communication establishes personal identities
4. Communication influences others

I think that all of these functions form a synergy that is hard to separate in real life. For example, I might communicate with the purpose of gathering information, but it is usually difficult to receive information without establishing your identity, which in turn influences others. I have only the most rudimentary understanding of quantum physics, but one of the main principles, as I understand it, is that the observer of phenomena, by the very act of observing, is also a participant. So our ideal of "objective observation" might very well be impossible. I think communication shares that same characteristic.

By communicating with others, we in fact influence them, and establish a relationship with them, which can in turn give us both clues about our place in society. Therefore, I think all of these functions are "realistic," even though we not be aware of all four in any given situation.


*** Murat
In Chapter 1 on page 24 and 25, religion is listed as one of the elements of culture. How do you think, do religion and culture go together? If so, Can culture be separated from religion?

**** Kristin
I don't believe culture and religion can be separated - I guess I'm speaking from my viewpoint of my culture and my Christian religion. A family's religion is so much a part of who they are, that they raise their children within that religious/belief system - values, customs, holiday/religious traditions, etc. In my opinion it's very intertwined, and unable to be separated.

**** Chia-Hua
Hi Murat: In my opinion, I believe that  religion gets together with culture. For me, Catholic is my religion. My parents always tell me to do the way that Catholic must to be. Thus, they educate me as a Catholic, we should prey and do some formal format before we make the decision. However, I strongly agree that every religions has their own culture. We should respect all of them.

**** Amy
I think that religion is one of the elements of a culture, but I also think that each religion also has its own culture. And I think the significance religion plays within the dominant culture or a co-culture is dependent on a wide range of factors. As an example, I think religion is a bigger part of Midwestern culture than it is on the East Coast. This may be the result of a more dominant religion in the central part of the the country. When I moved to Pennsylvania from Missouri, I quickly learned that "Merry Christmas" was much less appropriate salutaion than "Happy Holidays." People also talk about their church or church activities much more frequently in this part of the country than in any other region where I have lived.

And the culture of a religion changes depending on where that religion is being practiced. The culture of Christianity I experienced in Korea was very different from the Chirsitan culture I experienced in the Unitied States. And Buddhism in Korea looks very different than it does in Japan, Thailand or Indonesia.

**** Me
This is a very interesting question. It really depends on how you define "culture" and "religion." If you consider culture to be based on national or ethnic identity, then we can look for countries that do not emphasize religion. There are many countries that claim to be "secular," but you could argue that the very act of promoting secular humanism is a *reaction* to religious thought--or perhaps even a form of "religious thought" itself.

What functions do religions serve?

I'm probably opening a huge can of worms, here, but a couple ideas include:

- A way of understanding the nature of humanity, and our place in the universe
- A (ideally) clear set of moral/ethical guidelines for living

Not all religions clearly state the existence of divine/supernatural beings, cosmology (how the earth was formed, for example), or what the purpose of life is, but they do all give an outline of proper behavior and social norms. That list is probably not exhaustive, but I think all religions do provide the functions I've listed above. Interestingly enough, you could argue that many philosophical systems meet those goals, as well. I took an online course on comparative religion through UC Berkeley a couple years ago, just for fun. We had some interesting debates on exactly what constitutes religion. Are Buddhism, Confucianism, or Daoism religions? How about secular humanism, Agnosticism, Atheism, or Utilitarianism?

I think Amy and Chia-Hua make a good point; most--if not all--major cultural groups have been influenced by some forms of religious thought and expression. Even the government of a modern country like the United States, which stresses the "Separation of Church and State" has a strong religious element. The symbolism of our money, for example, is derived from the Deistic worldview that inspired many of our founding fathers. Whether they embrace one religion, many religions, or no religion, each culture must make a choice about its beliefs and values.

However, I think Amy makes and excellent point: religions themselves have their own cultures. If you examine any of the major world religions, you can see that they have both influenced local cultures, and also been influenced by them.

I don't want to split hairs, but at what point do we draw the line between culture and subculture? Even if we agree that all cultures are inseparable from religion, do we think the same is true of subcultures?

I would tend to say that religious and/or philosophical systems pervade most major, established cultures, but it is possible for a culture or subculture to lack an element of religion.


*** Sara
According to the text, one reason that communication is complex is that people are both alike and different.

What are some examples that illustrate how people's similarities and differences interact to create complexities in communication?

How might similarities and differences create alternate complexities in international interaction versus domestic interaction?

**** Me

This is a really interesting question. I'm not sure I can come up with a very convincing argument, but I do have a few thoughts...

At first glance, it would seem that people's similarities would lead to increased harmony, but that is not always the case.
My first thought when I read this was Carl Jung's concept of the Shadow, which was his observation that people tend to project the negative qualities that they dislike in themselves onto other people, and criticize them, while ignoring their own similar flaws. (For instance, I might be very selfish, but I fail to admit this to myself. But when you act in what I consider to be a selfish manner, I get very angry at you.)

But upon further reflection, we can look at this from another perspective. To members within an in-group, there are divergent values, opinions, and forms, but to members outside of the group, they tend to see the group as being more homogenous. For example, a European person could go to Beijing and think everyone looks about the same, but among the Asians in Beijing, they will look at each other and notice regional, ethnic, and even national differences. People always talk about "the Japanese" as if they are clones, but I would argue they value individuality just as much as Americans do. They simply tend to not show it publicly. In terms of complexity of communication, it doesn't get much more complex than in Japan. :)

In political movements, there are often struggles between radical and more moderate factions. Although they ostensively seek the same goal, they might differ in the methodology and degree to which they are willing to sacrifice to reach their goals. This can cause a great deal of difficulty within the group.

When considering the difficulties of intercultural communication, I think it is instructive to take a step back, and ask ourselves if the problems are really about cultural difference. Before I switched to Asian Studies, I spent a semester as a Psych major, here at UMKC... :) One psychology theory has really given me a unique perspective in my intercultural dealings: Fundamental Attribute Theory. Wikipedia has a good description:

In social psychology, the fundamental attribution error (also known as correspondence bias or attribution effect) describes the tendency to over-value dispositional or personality-based explanations for the observed behaviors of others while under-valuing situational explanations for those behaviors. The fundamental attribution error is most visible when people explain the behavior of others. It does not explain interpretations of one's own behavior—where situational factors are often taken into consideration. This discrepancy is called the actor–observer bias.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error

I still remember my professor's example:

Say you look out the window, on cold, icy day, and you see a guy slip and fall. Why do you think he fell? If you're like most people, you will assume he is clumsy. You'll blame *him*. But this guy, John, is captain of the Judo club, and he has amazing balance. He grew up on a farm, and he never falls on the ice. But he'd just broken up with his girlfriend, so he wasn't paying attention. He blames *her* and/or the ice! 

Now, you might be wondering what this has to do with intercultural communication, but I have experienced this hundreds of times: a problem/miscommunication/difference of opinion based on personality or situational factors is incorrectly attributed to cultural factors ("Oh he said that because he is an American."). 

Now, I don't think I was taught this, so I might be wrong, but I suppose that this type of thinking, if repeated enough times, leads to the very kinds of prejudice and stereotyping we hope to avoid. 

Consider:

"She's a woman driver."
"He's a man, and all men are insensitive."
"Those people don't value human life like we do."
"Islam promotes terrorism."

Once again, I wrote way too much to say a simple thing. Cultural differences can undoubtedly cause difficulties, but I actually think people tend to be more cautious when they are in those kinds of settings. I would say that communication difficulties are just as pervasive and complex within any given in-group than they are with outsiders (if not more so).

The authors gave us the German proverb, "A country can be judged by the quality of its proverbs (pg 29)." What do you think the proverbs and sayings (those listed in the chapter as well as others you might know) of different countries say about each country? Do you agree with the authors in the interpretations they give on pages 29 - 31? Why or why not?

**** Me

That was one of my favorite areas of the chapter. I have always enjoyed learning proverbs and sayings. I think the authors are right when they say that proverbs reflect the values and experience of a culture. I agreed with most of their interpretations, but on the middle of page 31, they mistakenly attributed "Those who speak do not know, and those who do know speak." to Confucius. Actually, that was Laozi. (See Chapter 56 of the Dao De Jing: http://ctext.org/dao-de-jing#n11647).

Also, I could be wrong, but I think they took it out of context. He literally says, "The person who knows, does not speak." The question is, what does "The person who knows" mean? Well, if you read it in context, he is talking about someone who has attained wisdom of "The Dao." I think what Laozi meant was that "Those who speak (about the Dao, or the Way of Nature/Life) do not understand it, and those who speak about it do not know. It's the same sentiment that you find in mystical writings from Sufis, Zen masters, Jews, Christians, or anyone else who has had a transcendent spiritual experience. But then again, maybe he really was just saying people shouldn't talk. Classical Chinese is a bit terse...

I smiled when I read the Japanese proverb, "Fall seven times, stand up eight," because I used to have a really cool fan with that proverb written on it, and a picture of Bodhidharma (similar to this one, but nicer: http://www.suzukisensu.com/shop/item/3816)

It is indicated that art is a mirror image of a society on page 33 of chapter 1. What is the function of art do you think whene learning a different culture? If possible, give some examples of art forms that may demonstrate your own culture.

**** Me

Art is an extremely important avenue for understanding culture (and subcultures...for example, grafitti.)

I'll give you an example. When I was studying Asian Studies, I focused on Chinese language and history. We learned about the various dynasties and all these large events that shaped Chinese history. But I took a class on Chinese art, and it opened up a whole new perspective for me. When historians talk about Eastern Zhou vs. Western Zhou, or Northern/Southern Sung, they really mean that invaders were pushing the central government further inward. But if you study the artwork from these areas, you'll find that the culture had completely changed, even before the failing dynasties had collapsed. These invading forces brought new cultural values and aesthetics with them.

If you haven't seen the Chinese art exhibit at the Nelson, I highly recommend a visit. It's not as great as what you'd find at the Beijing Capital Museum, of course, but it is one of the best collections in the US. The main author of our textbook in the class, Lawrence Sickman, spent much of the 1930s grabbing up a lot of amazing art in China, and bringing it back to the Nelson. When we studied Chinese art, a lot of the pieces we studied were right here in Kansas City (many of them are not on display, and we were able to get special access to things the public never sees). I took my wife there a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, they have a lot of Shang/Zhou bronzes and jades that I wanted to see, but they are not on display now. One of the staff members said they are looking for funds to build a new wing to display them. I was disappointed, but hopefully, they will be able to display it again soon. Also, they had a special exhibition, so many of my favorite paintings and scrolls were not on display, either.

Sorry, but I can't speak for western art, because I am completely ignorant. I am not an expert on Asian art either, but I have studied it to some degree, so I will discuss that. As everyone knows, The Silk Road was a major avenue for commercial and cultural exchange. You can see a wondeful blend of Chinese, Indian, Arabic, and Hellenistic art and culture, which tells a very interesting story. For example, in Asia, Buddhist art is a great way to look at cultural difference, in the same way that Christian art is in Europe. If you look at depictions of Guanyin and other Buddhist figures, you can see a lot of differences. 

For instance, if you look at this Guanyin image http://www.nelson-atkins.org/art/CollectionDatabase.cfm?id=597&theme=china, you can see that Guanyin is very lean, alert, and dynamic (and more masculine). But if you look at some of the Southern Sung depictions of Guanyin, you'll see a very corpulent, sedentary, feminine Guanyin. The personalities of the cultures show through in the art their artists created. (Unfortunately, the painting I have in mind is not on display now, but when the current East/West Landscapes exhibit is over, they may display it again.)

Many of our classmates have traveled throughout the world. What would you say was the biggest difference (ex: religion, customs, beliefs. etc), if you could choose one, that was apparent to you immediately, from your own culture compared to the culture that you visited or lived?

**** Chloe
When I traveled to Taiwan this past summer, the first difference I noticed was how much the people ate out.  I discovered that it was actually cheaper to eat out whether it be from buying food from a stand on the street or even going to a sit down restaurant. I found that most people would go out to eat. because of that there were significantly more places to purchase food. The demand for food places is so high that one stand can not saturate the need, therefore there will be multiple stands selling the same product on one street. This cultural difference also creates an atmosphere at night that is unlike most in the united states. Between the hours of 6 to 9 you will find many people especially those of the younger generation hanging out at what they call a night market.

**** Amy
For me, it was shoes! When I lived in London and traveled extensively through Europe, the footware of each country was very distinct. I used to joke that I could tell you where someone was from just by looking at their shoes.

**** Me
Many Japanese have asked me this question. Wow, I wish I could give a better story about my initial impressions of Japan. To be honest, I hadn't slept in two days, and I was just utterly exhausted. I did my best to prepare myself for Japan; I had Japanese friends, I could speak at an intermediate level, and I could read almost everything...I felt like I was ready. Of course, I wasn't. :)

I guess the biggest thing that hit me was the sheer number of people. Even though I was prepared for that, it was a bit of a shock to actually experience it. And I think I hit my head at least once a day, for the entire time I was in Japan! That and that when I was in Seattle, everyone was really impressed that I could speak in Japanese, but in Japan, no one was impressed...I remember that after I got settled into my apartment, I decided to take a walk, and I got lost and couldn't find my way home for almost an hour. The next morning, I went to my first Aikido class in Japan. I still remember that time, when I was so excited, and I didn't work seven days a week, like a crazy Japanese salaryman.

My first visit to China made more of an impression. I arrived in Beijing Airport, and everyone was loud, and everyone was trying to hustle me. I was in town to go to my friend's wedding, and her cousin was supposed to meet me. She was late, and I was a bit annoyed with her. I guess I can forgive her, since I ended up marrying her. ;)

I also remember the first time I came back to the US. Having lived in Japan and being used to being guided by staff all the time, I went to the flight attendant and asked her where to put my luggage. As it turned out, I sat across from her, and the two American guys next to me were reading the same John Clancy novel. She asked them about it, and then, seeing that I was reading a Japanese book, she asked what was wrong with me. I was really angry, but I just smiled. I remember that first time, I used Japanese gestures, bowed, and kept starting to speak Japanese to cashiers. I think the first time I went back and forth, it was hard, but now it is easier. 

Living in another culture is one of the most rewarding, frustrating, and unforgettable things you can do. I would recommend staying long enough to enjoy it, but not so long that it becomes an ordeal.

The book talks about how key communication is to culture. Communication as defined in the book is the sharing of one's internal state through symbols.  What are some practical examples of differences in "symbols" between cultures?

**** Me

I think there are many:

1. formal spoken/written language
2. informal spoken/written language
3. art
4. media and pop culture
5. gestures (!)
6. aesthetic ideals of beauty and style
7. archetypes
8. unspoken rules of communication, like eye contact, the length of pauses, the amount of feedback when people talk, proximity, level of personal touching, etc.

One of the most interesting for me has been gestures. I actually miss a lot of gestures and the bowing that was so commonplace in Japan. 


*** Amy
Is it possible for a person to perceive the world through a cultural lens other than their own?

**** Me
Yes, I think so. But there is also a strange sense of dissonance when you realize that is happening, at least in my experience.

I remember once in Japan, I was on the train and I saw some foreigners and I thought, "Those foreigners are noisy!"

And then I would feel very strange. :)

Sorry, I changed my post and hit "submit" without realizing my mistake. Of course, I meant to say, "I *felt* strange.
