**** Ways to Encourage Collaborative Learning
***** 1. Discussion Boards

****** When properly designed, collaborative learning lessons can reduce the temptation for students to plagarize, because they can work with others to build upon their understanding, and because of peer review
- Each individual's role must be clearly defined and agreed upon by
  everyone in the group.
- Each student must have a specific task to accomplish, and he or she
  must be accountable for that task.

***** How Does Blackboard Facilitate Collaborative Learning? 
Blackboard offers several ways to facilitate
group learning. This session will focus on using the Blackboard Group
Tool to encourage students to work together to improve learning outcomes.

***** Advantages of BB Group Tools
- Native feature of Blackboard
- Offer integrated approach to collaborative learning
***** Disadvantages of BB Group Tools
- Content sharing is limited to groups (not available to entire class)
- Group Assignments are submitted by one person (can be difficult to
  ensure that all members have shared in the workload)
***** What tools are available?
****** "Native Tools"
- Blogs: In the Group area, all members of a Group can create entries
  for the same Blog, building upon one another. Any Course member can
  read and comment on a Group Blog, but cannot make Entries if they
  are not a member of the Group. Instructors can select the grade
  option for Group Blogs.
- Collaboration: Users within the Group can create and attend Chat sessions and Virtual Classroom sessions.
- Discussion Board: Users within the Group can create and manage their own Forums.
- Email: Users within the Group can email individual members or the entire Group.
- File Exchange: Group members and the Instructor can share files in
  this area. All members, as well as the Instructor, can add
  files. They can also delete files, regardless of who added them.
- Journals: When used in the Group area, all members of a Group can
  view each other's Entries, but the Group Journal can only be viewed
  by the Group and the Instructor. Instructors can select the grade
  option for Journals.
- Tasks: Users within the Group can create Tasks that are distributed to all Group members.
- Wikis: User

start of semester classes, so please wait until then. 

Some instructors might choose to make classes available before or
after that date, so if you believe that your course site should be
available to you, and it's been more than one business day since you
verified your enrollment in Pathway, please contact your Instructor or
the Academic Department. Our staff cannot make courses available to
you.

If you need information about books, check with the UMKC Bookstore, at

******* Hours
We are open Monday through Friday from 7:00AM-6:00PM for phone call (816-235-6700) and e-mail support (its@umkc.edu). Additionally we also offer online chat assistance on Sundays and Mondays from 6:00PM-10:00PM as well as on Tuesdays from 8:00PM-10:00PM. To reach the chat, just click the "Live Support" button on the Blackboard homepage.



******* Browser Issues
First, you can try deleting your browser's cache (saved data from websites you've visited). For a number of browser-related issues, this solution can work. Here is a link to some instructions on how to do this using various different types of browsers:
http://www.wikihow.com/Clear-Your-Browser's-Cache
Next you can do a Browser Check. This will scan your browser to ensure that all of the necessary plug-ins are installed and the settings are set properly to run Blackboard. To do this, go to the Blackboard homepage (blackboard.umkc.edu). Make sure you are logged out, and scroll down to the module that says “Browser Test.” Click “Run Browser Check” and this will load a page that will tell you which items you may need to either install or adjust to access Blackboard.
If an "x" instead of a checkmark appears next to any of the items on your Browser Check, be sure to update whatever plug-ins it describes (Java, Flash, etc.). It can also help to disable any extra add-ons not necessary to Blackboard you may have installed yourself.
If none of these strategies work, try to access Blackboard using a different Browser. For any other issues related to your computer or internet connection contact the IT Call Center at (816) 235-2000.
******* Blackboard Login Issues
If you are still having trouble logging in to Blackboard, try checking out this page that lists some common issues and solutions:
http://dev.umkc.edu/kb/classroom%20technologies/UMKC%20Blackboard/20111003-bb-user- loginfail.html
An important thing to note is that your Blackboard account syncs with your Pathway account so it is always best to check and see if you can log in to Pathway if you ever have issues with Blackboard. Your password for Pathway automatically expires (with notice through e-mail) every six months so sometimes resetting your Pathway password is your solution. Also make sure not to include the "@umkc.edu" with your SSO.
If you are still having trouble logging on, feel free to give our office a call and we can work through the issue with you.
******* Can Only See Announcements
This issue might be related to the viewing options you have set on Blackboard. If you access one of your course sites, on the far left side of the screen past the Announcements module should be a small grey box with an arrow on it. Click this, and the links to your Course Content, Tools, and other Blackboard areas will appear. I’ve attached a screenshot with a picture of this box as well.

******* Generic Tegrity Issues
Hello,
Which class are you having Tegrity issues with? If you let us know which specific course, we can look it up for you and determine what the issue might be. I recommend contacting our office directly at 816-235-6700. We are open Monday through Friday from 7:00AM-6:00PM.
In the meantime, try checking out our Tegrity support page here:
http://www.umkc.edu/ia/its/podcasting/it-help.cfm
On this page is a link that says "Test My Computer." If you click it, it will bring you to a page that will run tests and determine if your computer is set up properly to run Tegrity.
Let us know if you have any more questions. Have a good day,
******* Data limit reached
Each Blackboard course site has a set data limit of 250 MB. You are currently at MB and that is why you are unable to upload additional content. To work around this issue, you have a few different options.
The most basic option is to delete some of the files to free up space. An important thing to remember with this is that when you go into the actual content area and “delete” a file, you are not actually deleting that file. What this does is merely get rid of the link. The data is still lurking in the background, ready to deploy to another section of the Blackboard site if requested. To permanently delete something and thus free up space you will need to access the “Files” section of the Control Panel. To access this area, click on the “Files” heading on the blue Control Panel on the left side of the screen to open up the sub-menu. When you do this, it will display a link that has your Course ID (it should look something like “UMKC-SUBJECT###...”) above a search bar. Click this link to access the Files management screen.
This screen will display a list of every file you have uploaded to this particular course. If you want to sort the files by their size, click the heading for the column labeled “size” to sort the files from smallest to largest. Click it again to sort them from largest to smallest (if you want to display them by date, you can also click the “Edited” column). To delete any of these files, simply check the box next to the name of the file and then click on the button that says “Delete” at the top or bottom of the screen (next to the “Copy” and “Move” buttons).
Another option is to use Equella. Equella is basically a data storage locker that lets you link to files you have uploaded to Equella on your Blackboard site without actually putting the data on Blackboard itself. This is a helpful tool for two reasons: it can enable you to add files for the students to view without worrying about your data limit and also makes those files easily available for any future course. This means that if you use the same PowerPoints, assignments, or other forms of data again for a different course you will not have to upload them a second time. I will attach instructions for Equella setup to this email if you are interested.
The third option is that we can double the data limit for a combo course to 500 MB. So if you merge two courses together via the Request System, we will manually change the settings for you because it will treat the courses as if they are one.
******* How to do a course combo
To do a course combo:
Whenever you log in to Blackboard there should be a “Request System” tab on the right side of your screen. Click this and on the next screen click “Combine Courses” under the Course Site Requests heading. From here you can choose the parent course that will act as the course that is visible to the students. Then select the child course(s) that will be combined together with the parent course. You can either choose to “Keep the enrollment,” which will keep the child course active and visible to students in that course or “Don’t Keep Enrollment,” the more typical option which basically gets rid of the child course and replaces it with the combined parent site. Once the request is completed it will be sent to our office and will be processed within 1-2 business days.

****** ITS Call Center
******* General Service Information
   - The Call Center is open from 7am to 6pm. At least one person should be in the Call Center during those hours. We also offer evening chat. Those hours could change, based on staff availability.
   - We offer in-person, phone, email, and live chat service. For in-person assistance, we generally try to make appointments with faculty, but sometimes users show up at our office unannounced. We do our best to accommodate them.
******** Daily Procedures
- At 7:00am, the Call Center opens.
- Check Request System tickets. For technical issues with the Request system, contact Duane Nettles.
- Check Remedy tickets. Lyn Magrone (Central Systems) is the support person for Remedy.
- Check the ITS Outlook Inbox. Each staff member has a folder. All mails are either answered or delegated to the appropriate staff member.
- At 6:00pm, the Call Center closes.
******** Weekly Procedures

******** Systems
- The ITS Outlook In box
  - Each employee has a folder in the Pending folder. These should be checked and ticketed every day.
  - Archives are kept on the N: drive:
- Blackboard Archives
  - Mary Crosson archives these sites on a regular basis each semester.
  - 2009 -- 2012 Blackboard course sites:
  - 2008 and older Blackboard course sites:
  - ITS Staff members sometimes receive requests to delete sandbox sites or organization sites. These sites are first archived and then copied to the appropriate Blackboard Archive folder, listed above.
******** Other Notes
- *Keys:* In addition to my keys, I have keys to Rooms 314 and 303 in the top drawer of my desk. The key for 303 also opens the Studio and the Classroom.

***** Pop-up Blockers
****** Mac
******** Issues
- Cannot open Tegrity recording list/A new Tegrity recording page
  opens, but is blank (Screenshot 1)
- "Your Tegrity sessions list could not open a new window. This may happen because a popup blocker application is used." (Screenshot 2)
******** Solution
******* Safari
1. In the *Safari* menu at the top of your screen, click *Safari* -->
   *Preferences* (Keyboard shortcut: ⌘,).
2. You'll see a *Preferences* window. Choose *Security*.
3. Under *Web Content*, make sure that the *Block pop-up windows*
   option is *unchecked*.
/Note: Safari does not include the option to allow exceptions for blocked sites, so if you uncheck this option to view Tegrity videos, you might want to check it afterwards, to prevent pop-ups on other sites./

******* Firefox
1. In the *Firefox* menu at the top of your screen, click *Firefox*
   --> *Preferences* (Keyboard shortcut: ⌘,). (Screenshot 1)
2. The *Preferences* window will pop up. Choose *Content*. Make sure
   that the box next to "Block pop-up window" is checked. Then click
   on *Exceptions*.
3. A new window, "Allowed Sites - Pop-ups" will appear. You'll see a
   list of websites that are excluded from the pop-up blocker. Make
   sure that the following sites are listed in the "Allow" box, and if not,
   add them:
   - blackboard.umkc.edu
   - roocast.umkc.edu
4. Close the Window.

| New Employee Training  | Active         | Last semester, I began the process of creating a better system of training documentation. I've found a lot of things that need to be improved or updated for future training. |
| Feher Performance Plan | Active         | I've spoken with Feher about his performance and am working with him to improve.                                                                                              |
| ITS Website            | Active         | Working with Kelsey and James to improve our website documentation. There is still a lot that we would like to include.                                                       |
| Chat canned responses  | Inactive       | These responses allow employees to click a button and insert a snippet of text into the chat window. I plan to create more in the future, based on staff feedback.            |

     existing documentation.
   - David will look at the E-Tools links and make sure they point to
     other websites.

     not working.
