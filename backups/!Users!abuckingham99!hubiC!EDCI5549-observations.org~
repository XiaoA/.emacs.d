   Lesson Topic: Building vocabulary ("School is Bad for Children")
   Prompt: #3 How did you help students to develop both social and academic language? or choose one
   Reading & Vocabulary
   - Class Activity: They went over the vocabulary homework, and the students contributed their example sentences.The students were allowed to find sentences in their corpus (The Corpus of Contemporary American English; [[corpus.byu.edu/coca]]) or make original sentences. Before the class, they came the front and gave the instructor their answers. He put them into a table in Word, and the person who'd found or made the sentence read it for the class. The instructor went over the meanings with them.
     - coalesce "you need to know how to coalesce the ingredients" (logical passive); "you need to know how to make the ingredients coalesce well"
   - Pair activity: The students worked in pairs to examine a passage in their books, and try to determine the meaning of the vocabulary words.
   - Class actvity: Discussing the Reading
   Criticisms
     1. Learning is separate from living.
     2. Learning is a passive process. (or: "He cannot be trusted to learn.")
     3. Students don't count as individuals in school/only the school system and the curriculum are important/The child learns to hide/be ashamed of curiosity and not ask questions. (Children learn they are worthless, and they are fit only to take orders)

Children learn that it is a crime to be wrong, and they develop these bad behaviors as a consequence:
1. cheating
2. faking
3. dodging
4. bluffing

   The charade of school: Schools say they value students as individuals and how to be successful, but in fact they don't.
   
He talked about the 200-year process of English losing its adverbs. When many native speakers speak, they might say, "I'm feeling good" or "It was a real good movie." But for academic English, it's best to use the proper adverbial forms.

** 105C Author: John Holt

   The students began with a vocabulary practice sheet, "What Are You Stingy About?" They worked with a parter to fill in the best vocabulary words from the list they've been studying this week. There are many Brazilian students in the class, and while we were helping the pair groups, one of them mentioned that a vocabulary word was just like what they said in Portuguese. The instructor talked about cognates that look the same, but sound different in Portuguese. He asked how to pronounce the word in Portuguese, and they talked for a moment about the differences between how the languages pronounces similar words.
   One of the challenges of teaching vocabulary is providing the context for students to know when to use one word with a similar meaning over another. Native speakers can judge the nuance of a word, and choose the correct one in almost any situation. Non-native speakers can develop this sense, but in the meantime, they need a basic set of guidelines to remember. Unfortunately, it can be hard to encapsulate all of the rules, conventions, and preferences that a typical native speaker might have in a lesson. I have noticed that this instructor has a very effective system for doing this. First, he asks what his students know. He then gives them some simple information about the etomyology or context of the word. Then, he provides a few examples. Even if the students are not able to grasp the difference at the time, they can refer back to this information later, because he puts it in Blackboard for them, or asks them to stop and write it down immediately. The class talked about the different connotations that words like cheap or frugal have. One thing that I have also used to teach this is to use exaggerated expressions and tones of voice, like saying, "frugal" with a grand, and expansive smile and posture, and saying "cheap" in a harsh tone, while scrunching over my imaginary money and scowling, like Scrooge. It might sound silly, but students tend to remember those kinds of images more clearly than a more abstract explanation of a word's meaning.
   After the instructor had clarified all of the words they had encountered in the practice sheet, they went back to their pairs and scoured the "School is Bad for Kids" article from their book, and they summarized the author's suggestions to improve the K-12 school system. They then discussed these as a class. They agreed that the biggest complain that the author had was that compulsory attendance had a negative effect on students, so they divided back into pairs, and debated the pros and cons of compulsory attendance. When everyone shared their ideas with the class, I was impressed with their ideas. It provided a good opportunity for students from different cultures to compare the relative strictness of their own upbrining with their peers.
   Often, the most memorable learning events in a class are completely unplanned. Students can change the dynamic of a class with a simple question. Or a chance thought when reading the same text can cause an instructor to say something that he or she has never said. The instructor made a comment in the text about how finding a penny face-up was good luck. We discussed US coins, which was a valuable segway into the final discussion on daily life and the importantance of cultural symbols. Many of the students were surprised that a face-up penny or a rabbit's foot could be seen as good luck. But I am sure that in their culture, they consider something that I would ignore as a portent of good fortune and happiness. We cannot discuss language apart from culture, as they are symbiotic. To understand the meaning of words like "frugal" or "cheap", it is useful to understand at least a little about the cultural context of why these words have positive or negative connotations. Likewise, as people from other cultures learn English, they must decide how these connotations fit in with their own native language and cultural cues.

   - the last line of the text referenced how a face-up penny was good luck. So we talked about US coins (good cultural/daily life segway).
   - Pair: go through the "School is bad for kids" text and summarize the author's suggestions to improve the K-12 school system.
   - Class: They went through the text and discussed the author's suggestions. They
   - Class discussion: Which of the suggestions did the author spend the most time on? --> conpulsory attendance.
   - Class discussion: They discussed the advantages/disadvantages of compulsory attendence.
     - A lot of good points.

*** Lession Topic: Montessori Educational Approach
*** 1:45pm - 3:00pm
    - The students watched a short video, produced by National Education Report. The instructor provided a list of 19 speakers, and the students wrote down the gist of what each speaker said about Montessori education.
    - The instructor stopped after each speaker, and the students worked in pairs/groups to discuss what the speaker had said, and write down the gist of what each speaker had said.
    - inquiry: meaning
      - question
      - curiosity
      - research

    The video introduced a lot of useful vocabulary, and the instructor did a good job of making sure that the students learned these words, and had a good idea of how to use them correctly.

    - The instructor used some of the speakers as a good example of how to speak effectively. For example, people gave clear arguments and supporting ideas and they organized their ideas in logical/chronological order.

      - Divide into pairs and discuss the following questions:
	1. What is your opinion of the Montessori Educational Approach? Give reasons and examples.

	2. Compare and contrast Montessori with Waldorf. How are they similar and how are they different? Give examples.

	3. How is Montessori and/or Waldorf similar to or different from your own elementary school education?

      - The students in this class love to talk, and they do not need to be encouraged to practice.

	Education is the foundation of culture. We learn how to think, act, and feel from our parents and teachers. Today, the class watched a video about Montessori education, and the instructor took the opportunity to elicit comparisions (native culture educational system vs. Montessori). He also talk about the importance of organizing ideas and arguments in English.

	*HW: Bring a list of 8-10 ways that Montessori and/or Waldorf is similar to or different from your own elementary school education.*

  10:00am - 11:45pm

  For the first 20 minutes, they wrote a small essay, answering a question she put up on the projector (timed writing).
She elicited the steps for the activity:
  - brainstorming (2-3 min)
  - writing
  - checking

    Question:
    Some people organize their schedules and plan their time carefully. Other people wait until the last minute to complete things. Why do some people (students) procrastinate?
    What are the effects  of doing this?
    Support your answer with reasons or examples.
    


**    Four types of evidence
    
     - Einstein evidence (expert evidence)

     - Examples

     - Facts

     - Undocumented

       Class: The class went through example sentences, and the students had to decide which of the four kinds of evidence they used.


     p63 Thesis Statements
     They looked at example sentences and used provided examples from the book to tell what kind of evidence it was, and whether it effectively supported the thesis statement.

     Pair Work: Examine the process essay they're writing. Check for:
     - A clear thesis
     - Check (gen) cause/effect
     - Check for evidence/supporting information


     She gave them 10 prompts for general questions, and asked them to choose a topic, and work on brainstorming and writing about the topic for 15 minutes.
     They all chose only one brainstorming topic. She's been working with them for a couple days to try to improve their ability to brainstorm, think of ways to approach the topic, find appropriate evidence, and write about it.

     without a time limit, ESOL students might find it hard to learn how to write timed essays in class, or just write something without overanalyzing/procrastinating.

  Lesson Topic: "Note taking for Lectures"/Internet Addiction (part 2)
  1:45pm - 3:00pm

  "Note taking for Lectures"
  - In the US, students are expected to study about three hours for each hour in class, and they should bring their own ideas to class.
    Pair/group discussion: How does this aspect of American higher education differ from your culture?

    this instrctor spent 7 years teaching in Mexico, so he is very aware of the kinds of cultural and language issues that ESL students have, and he tries to help them develop strategies for dealing with these issues.

    The students genuinely care about each others' progress, and they do a great job of staying on task and cooperating. You don't have to tell them to speak English.

  Class:    Some of the students said that they never read before the lectures. The instructor told them that American professors usually expect students to do their own studying/research outside of class to compliment the lectures.

  Note-taking:
  - have your notebook out and ready to go.
  - take notes on the verbal part of the lecture.
  - focus on "key words" and important concepts; don't write down everything (full sentences are not necessary).
  - put class date/name on the paper
  - note important test/due dates
  - keep your syllabus with you, and note any updates.
  - wide left margin

Useful shorthand abbreviations and symbols

They used this knowledge of note-taking to take notes for a video on internet addiction

they worked in pairs to discuss their notes.

- 8:30am - 9:15am
  We're approaching the last couple weeks of the course, and everyone seems a bit less excited and enthusiastic. The students sometimes keep talking, even when the instructor does, and she seems a bit unhappy with that. But it is at these points in a course where the relationship between the instructor and the students is so important. The great advantage of teaching the same students every day is that you can learn about them, and how they think, and you can relate the content and subject matter to your students.

  they talked in their pairs about this. one of the students asked about the difference between signs and banners, and picket signs

  i spoke with one of the groups, and they said that they didnt think women should fight in wars, or be judges, because they are not objective enough.

Lesson Topic: Supporting Topic Sentences with arguments, examples, and quotes/paraphrases
- paraphrasing vs. quoting
  Class: they took turns reading their homework: reading sentences and choosing whether they were paraphrases or quotes
- APA vs. MLA
  Guidelines
  A good paraphrase:
  - doesn't add or remove any of the original meaning
  - is different enough to not be a copy

    Why is evidence important?
    - it supports your thesis statement and arguments.

pairs/groups: extensive reading of an article
The class went through and identified the main points and arguments
- cause and effect
- evidence

  class energy was low. I'd suggest mixing it up and getting them more involved. (making teams/competition)

    - Must be verifiable
    - Face that reasonable people would concede
    - An argument is careful reasoning in support of a claim.

Lesosn Topic: Gender Roles and Discussing Graphs

- The instructor showed them a graph that shows the monthly budget allocation of Ms. Bradshaw, a fictional female employee.
  - Showing the breakdown graphically was a very effective visual aid

** Jigsaw 
   - divided class into pairs, then split the class into "A" and "B".
   - the "A" groups focuses on the "Team A" vocabulary list and found the meaning; the "B" groups found the meaning for the "Team B" words
   - Person 1 from each pair stood up and went over the other side (A -> B; B -> A)

     level off. I helped a pair define the word with gestures and I elicited "a period of incresing/decreasing"
