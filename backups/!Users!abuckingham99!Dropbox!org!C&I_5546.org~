Samovar 98: Worldview & Culture: 
  - As I wrote in RP1, based on, but not limited to, my upbringing
  - Comfortable with ambiguities (upon further reflection)
  - sometimes very "American"/other times not; in constant state of flux (perhaps i confused "culture" with "worldview.")

  - partially spiritual, partially secular

  - complex
  - comfortable with ambiguity
  - more focused on proper action and doing what is right, than on questions that are unanswerable

       I decided not to pursue this line of thought.

Sometimes, I think that my open-mindedness and willingness to accept ambiguity is a double-edged sword. While it allows me to be open-minded and accepting of a wide variety of cultural norms and divergent worldviews, it does not provide me with a clear view that my opinions and actions are "right". While I am glad that I am open-minded, I must admit there have been many times when I felt a slight twinge of envy at people who were completely confident in their own views. Like many other introspective people I know, I have spent many moments agonizing over my beliefs and values, compared to people who apparently follow what they were taught as children. But in the end, I think it is better to truly explore the workings of my heart and mind, rather than simply flail around blindly. While I make just as many mistakes (if not more), at least I can take  comfort in the fact that I have made a conscious decision to be true to my own value system.

I believe that my worldview is just as arbitrary and prone to error as anyone else's, so I cannot claim to answer these questions with any authority. But

*** Draft

*My Worldview*

In my first reflection paper, I wrote, "I am a white American male, of mixed European ancestry, and that will always have some influence over how I see the world. But it does not define who I am, or my cultural identity." Now I wonder if perhaps I haven't been confusing culture and worldview all this time.

Samovar, Porter, and McDaniel define worldview as ??? (98). 

I'd like to briefly address these:

 - What is the purpose of life?
       I don't believe there is one specific purpose. I believe human being attribute patterns and meanings to random patterns. (Patternicity quote)
    - Is the world ruled by law, chance, or "God"?
      I honestly cannot decide this. Growing up in the Catholic faith, I learned that the world was designed by God, but that we also had free will to decide what was right and wrong. While I do not really subscribe to the idea of Intelligent Design, I can understand how people feel that the complexity of life must be attributable to God's will. I suppose I believe that things happen based on some form of natural law (We could call it "Dao" just as easily as anything), but the "scientist" in me questions even that. I would say it is a law only to the extent that every action has a reaction like cause and effect; I don't believe that this was was specifically created by God.

    - What is the right way to live? 

      Of all the questions listed, I think this is the most important for us to consider, for two reasons: 1) It is the only question that we can truly answer as human beings, and 2) It is the most most pertinent question for living in society. I would argue that all social groups, no matter how large or small, rely some degree of agreement on the proper way to act and behave. Without these rules, we could not interact with others. This is, of course, the primary function of socialization; even if we cannot agree on the existence of deities or the meaning of life and death, we can certainly agree that there are a set of behaviors that are both beneficial and harmful for society.

    - How did the world begin?
      
      I have always been fascinated by the Hindu myth that when Vishnu sleeps, he dreams up the existence of the universe, and when he awakens, the world is destroyed. Then, it is reborn again when he sleeps again. But I do not believe in that, any more than I believe that Yahweh created the world in six days. Somehow, all of existence exploded from a void, and will likely return to that eventually. I suppose the big bang theory makes the most sense to me, but it does not necessarily preclude the possibilty that one or more religious explanation is true, as well.

    - What happens when we die?

      I tend to believe that reincarnation makes sense, but that all of the consciousness and personality that comprise "Andrew Buckingham" will die with my body. Perhaps nothing happens. Or I might be going to heaven or hell.

As you can see from my answers, I have a high threashold for ambiguity. I admit that I do not know the answers to these questions, and that does not particularly concern me. And I freely admit that the beliefs that I do hold are rather vague and arbitrary.

*My worldview compared to that of my culture/country*

*The role of religion in my culture's worldview*

America is still predominantly religious, but Americans are becoming less religious over time. According to a 2009

** My Questions
   DEADLINE: <2011-09-07 Wed 23:59>


1) Balancing Ethnocentricty and Relativism

When dealing with people with different worldviews, I think we generally agree that we should try to be open and understanding of divergent viewpoints. But at the same time, there might be certain times when we might need to establish limits, and stand up for what we think is right. 

Is it possible to be too understanding of opposing viewpoints? How do you think we can balance the desire to be open-minded with the desire to hold true to what we think is right? How might you approach this issue?

2) Are there any worldviews or values that you personally find difficult to accept? How do you relate to people who espouse these views?

On page 113 of the text, it says, "The Christian God is a personal God who desires a relationship with his creation...Christianity is an especially appealing religion in that each person can have a one-on-one bond with God." The text seems to implicate that this one-on-one bond is one of the reasons for the huge popularity of the religion throughout the world. How can this be since for the greater part of the history of Christianity the largest sect, Catholicism, has made it nearly impossible for lay people to have any direct lines of communication with God, insofar as outlawing the printing Bibles in any language but Latin (at least until after the Reformation) and even conducting services only in Latin? Is this something which is a more modern event?
**** Me

This is an excellent criticism. As a *former* Catholic, I can agree that The Church has had a very tattered past, but it has improved in many ways since the Reformation. Certainly, the development of Protestantism, as well as the rise of Secular Humanism, democratic forms of government, and scientific inquiry provided great challenges to the hegemony of the Roman Church. 

Since Vatican II in the 1960s, the Catholic Church has made a great many changes, including introducing masses in the vernacular language, simplifying and modernizing rituals and teachings, and also making the radical decree that even non-Christians are able to go to heaven (sorry, I don't have a source, but it is from Huston Smith's "The Religions of Man." I can dig up an old research paper if necessary.) 

In many ways, the Catholic Church has embraced a great number of changes. But they still have failed to make a number of necessary changes, in my opinion.

Dear All,

I think the term "worldview" is very wide, and when it is asked to someone we can get lots of different answers and opinions. In our textbook on page 98, it also says that worldviews deal with a broad range of topics, such as 
- What is the purpose of life?
- Is the world ruled by law, chance, or "God"?
- What is the right way to live?
- How did the world begin?
- What happens when we die?
- In your opinion which of the questions above could best summarize the term "worldview", and why?

**** Me
I think all of these questions are important, but if I had to choose only one, I would choose "What is the right way to live?" because it is the most pressing question we face (and the only one we can truly answer with anything close to 100%.)

There is a story attributed to the buddha (see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_arrow]]), where, when asked a series of deep, metaphysical questions, the Buddha related a parable about a man shot with a poisoned arrow. 

To paraphrase: If the man were to spend his time trying to determine the materials used in the arrow, and who shot it, he would die before finding the cure to the poison. The point is that all of these questions are fascinating, but ultimately, we cannot answer them. Instead, we should try to find the "cure" to the "poison" (which I interpret as ignorance and delusive thinking...) 

I think this is a really good reminder to us that our lives are too short, and it is too easy to get distracted by things that do no matter, rather than focusing on what does matter. 

Of course, deciding what does matter is something that each of us must determine, but it goes back to the third question. I do think it is good to question the nature of reality, and what happens when we die. But most importantly, I think we should focus on how to live.

The book focused mostly on the various types of religions that effect our worldview.  However, I believe that there is a changing pattern especially among the younger generations.  Many of the younger generations are choosing to distance themselves from their parents' religion. Sometimes these individuals end up picking another religion. Other times they avoid the topic and thought altogether actively choosing to remain undecided  How do you think this will effect their worldview?
**** 

Yes, I agree, and I honestly think that they might have overstated the role of religion in many people's lives. While it's true that all traditional societies have developed worldviews based largely on religious ritual and kinship rules, I think modern societies have become more complex and hetrogenous. For many people, technology, social networking, economic concerns, and the constant stream of entertainment have replaced religion as the dominant expression of their worldview. Despite the fact that technology connects us more than ever, it also tends to separate many of us from the traditional groups that once bonded us with our friends and communities. When I was a boy, it was common for people to sit on their front porches, and greet their neighbors by name. While those rituals still exist, they are becoming more rare, as far as I can tell. Many people are so engrossed in their mobile communication and entertainment device, that they do not even pay attention when they drive!

Although the survey sample is rather limited at 35,000 people, I think this 2008 survey ([[http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf]]), conducted by Pew Research Group, is fairly indicative of the changes in religiosity in the United States. This is not relegated to the U.S., by any means. I was much more interested and informed about Asian religions and philosophy than almost anyone I met in Japan or China.

There is a good side to this, I think. In the past, people's viewpoints and lifestyles were generally limited by geography and social class. But now there is a great amount of information available, and more people than ever have the time, money, and opportunity to make conscious choices about what is important to them, and adopt lifestyles and viewpoints that are radically different from what they learned as children.

I know that this has been a great source of personal inspiration for me, in my life. As scholars and educators, I think it is important for us to make every effort to examine our own worldviews, and understand how changes in our social system have changed how we define words like "culture" and "worldview."

(I suppose I didn't actually answer the part about young people, because I think this issue applies equally well to me, and I am not very young, at least according to my wife and her younger brother...)

How do you think a person's worldview is affected by differing influences? For example, how would a person's worldview be affected by converting to a different religion during middle age? How would a person's worldview be influenced by an upbringing by parents whose worldviews would likely be different and even in opposition such as a Chinese father and American mother?

**** Me

Sara, this is something most of us probably have experience with, with globalization and the internet. It is striking to think how much more people balance today than they did even

I remember working as an administrator with a strong, devout, and set-his-views person of faith.  In this case it dealt with the role of women in society and our legal system.  We all work with and know good persons of strong faith with determined views and I am wondering what, as teachers, we should do--or not do--when communicating with persons like this.  I am interested in your sense on this so I can weigh my own responses in light of your thinking. 

What type of approach might you take in communicating with students like this whose beliefs might come into, and possibly clash with, classroom topics, classroom relationships, and your teaching?  

Steve

**** 

I would challenge his beliefs. Now let me backtrack a bit. When I taught adults, I always established a set of classroom expectations, or norms. The most fundamental one was respect other's opinions. However, I went out of my way to spend time on the language necessary to challenge someone's ideas without demeaning those beliefs or the person who holds them. Some ideas: 1) Open-ended questions that make people examine their beliefs, and 2) Hypothetical that establish a similarly extreme perspective in a different context.
**** Me
I think it depends a lot on the situation. I think Amy's response is an excellent one, but I also know that I personally have been in situations where I didn't feel that I had that freedom. In Japan, I was expected to smile and bow, even when people said things that I felt insulting, for example. Also, I have a friend who is teaching at a community college in Texas, and he has related some real horror stories...

I think communication is the first step, but there are just certain cases where communication won't help, as the text also states (sorry, I don't have the text with me, so I can't give the exact page). Challenging their views is a good option in some cases, as is simply ignoring it, or even consulting someone with more authority, if the person is truly disruptive. 

As an instructor, my attitude was that ultimately, it was my responsibility to maintain order and prevent one person from hijacking the learning environment. However, that can sometimes be easier said than done.
