Today, 小雪 and I watched Season 6, Episode 2 of /Dead Zone./ ("Ego"). After that, I watched the /Christmas Carol/ with Jim Carrey. It was nice. Angela and I went and paid the locker for the month.

I haven't been keeping a daily journal since September. I am going to go back to this. I am trying to set up a system to help me organize myself better for the upcoming year. I think I have a good idea of how i want to proceed. Back to org-mode, once again, but this time I don't want to try to force myself to copy someone else's "GTD Workflow." I want to create something that makes sense for me.

Time for bed.

Today, I stayed home. I was a bit tired and "worthless." I bought donuts at Lamar's, and then 小雪 and I watched /Hulk/. I did some reading and worked on my planning and productivity system for 2012. We had a stuffed crust pizza (hamburger and ham?) from Papa Murphy's.

It's 6:19am. I'm on the 156 Red Bridge bus. We are just now about to cross 89th and Wornall. I'm heading to work. I feel calm and content, but I know that I must make a lot of changes in my life. It is time to start really putting my ideals and beliefs into action, rather than just "waiting for the right time." P

Last night, Angela took us to Sweet Tomato for dinner. It was fun, and it tasted good. The only problem is that I just don't feel good after eating so much anymore. But it was still a fun night.

It's 10:49. I'm at the Student Hub. It's about time to head to work. I just finished the Nan-Senge dialogue PDF. It is loaded with information. I think I will have to read it a few times...
