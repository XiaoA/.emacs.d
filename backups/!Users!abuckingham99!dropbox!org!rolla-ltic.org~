* Bb Upgrade
Kelly - Waiting for dev environment to be cloned
Terry - April data release 
- update/install environment
- 4 60-minute webinar
- SP14 instance installed
-waiting for ICM instance to be created/ security
- internal performance testing group - pushed to May
- CSG very slow in building out; frustrating
- 


ECM filers
2 data centers, written in parallel; database data can be restored from either in a matter of hours, at worst
- re-mount

Kelly: 
** Daily
(Kelly, Kevin, and Terry)
- around 2/3 am Activity Accumulator moved to stats
- Data guard archive about every 15 minutes written during busy times; longer during slow periods (15 min is the limit recommended by Oracle)
- middle of the night backup disk - tape -> off-site


*** Example

Somewhere between 10am and 10:35am, there was a total failure.
You're not sure when the issue occurred, but you think it's around 10:00am. 
You can roll back to 9:59am.

If you're using current content, anything afer 10:00 would be orphaned.

The content file system /database (nightly log backup) separate, so if the content system is fine, you can just remount it and then go back to the time before the incident happened

MOU 

** App Dynamics
Kelly - very useful for monitoring and reporting 
Java hooks for monitoring

* Canvas

** Rolla Committee has endorsed Canvas Pilot
- Decision much faster than expected
- faculty/students very enthusiastic
- Cost of ownership study underway (last thing they looked at)
  - Canvas significantly cheaper than Bb ($100,000 less)
- Conversion costs
- 18-month parallel environment
- Increased support
- Working with Michigan Tech and other campuses that have converted to Canvas
  
- Meg the advantages of UM System all using the same LMS are not being discounted lightly
