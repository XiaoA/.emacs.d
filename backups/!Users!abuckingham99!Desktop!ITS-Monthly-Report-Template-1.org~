* July 2013 Monthly Report

** Projects and Areas of Responsibility

1. *Documentation and User Training*

   -  *Website*: I asked Dante and Brittney to come up with some
      material to put on the website for Adaptive Release, but I haven't
      had a chance to integrate it yet. We have a lot more to put on the
      site, including:

      -  The Request System/Enrollment pages need to be re-organized. We
         have some Organization site information on the Course site
         section.
      -  We need to put up information about more of the features of
         Blackboard, like:

         -  Adaptive Release
         -  Early Warning System

   -  We also need to add more depth to the information we have, as many
      key features and processes are still not documented.
   -  We need to do a better job of utilizing the information from
      [[http://help.blackboard.com][Blackboard Help]]. I wrote about
      this in my BbWorld 2013 Workshop write-up.
   -  *OneNote*:

      -  Created or edited 22 OneNotes.

   -  *User Training*

      -  Met with Theresa Torres twice

         1. Respondus
         2. Final Exam upload issues

   -  DNP Summer Institute (#2): 7/24 at 2:40pm

2. *Staff Training and Development*

   -  *Staff Meetings*:

      -  Every month, I meet with each staff member individually. No one
         had any major problems to report this time.

   -  *Other*

      -  Attended BbWorld 2013 with Mary Crosson from 7/8 - 7/11. I sent
         out a write-up on the workshops I attended on 7/30.
      -  We hired James Leftwich
      -  Matt Davis resigned. His last day was on 8/1.

** Challenges

July was a very challenging month for ITS. We upgraded Blackboard from
PS8 to SP11, but there were a lot of issues:

-  Duane's data feed/SIS integration issues caused problems with BB
   enrollment
-  MU didn't install the BB patches properly. Once the patches were
   installed, several serious issues were resolved:

   1. A bug that caused tests that were imported from another course
      site or through Respondus to make the Tests area unavailable
      (unending "Updating" message). Mary had been able to update the
      assessments flag on a per-upload basis, but that was not going to
      be a viable solution.
   2. "Invalid HTML" errors from invalid HTML from content pasted from
      Word (not completely resolved; it could be that the update didn't
      resolve all of these issues, or it could be that the BB Content
      Editor is not as good as Blackboard claims at interpreted

** Goals

FS2013 is coming soon. We'll have a Blackboard Boot Camp next month.
We're still trying to hire two more PT staff members, while we prepare
for another busy FS2013 semester.
