** Setting up your work environment

1. Download the chat client here:
   [[http://www.providesupport.com/downloads/index.html]]
2. Enter your user information:

   -  *Account Name*: UMKC\_Blackboard
   -  *Operator Login*: (Your Admin Login)
   -  *Password*: (Your password. If you've forgotten it, let me know).

3. Log in to the ITS email, as well as your own (you can have both open
   in the same browser).

   -  *ITS Webmail URL*: [[http://webmail.umkc.edu]]
   -  *User*: umkc-users\umkcbb
   -  *Password*: All1gatorhead

4. Recommendation: Keep a list of commonly-used snippets, so that you
   can copy and paste them. I have an app on my Mac called TextExpander,
   which lets me type in small keystroke shortcuts, which expand into
   commonly-used texts and links. Looks like there are equivalent
   options for Windows, if you are interested:
   [[https://www.google.com/search?q=TextExpander+for+windows&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&channel=fflb]].
   (Or just use the Canned Chat snippets!)

** Ground Rules

1. During peak periods, you will be busy on the chat. Do your best to
   answer all of the chats. You can ask callers to wait. I recommend
   keeping a list of commonly-used expressions on a separate file to
   copy and paste from, so you can let people know that you will be with
   them in a moment, as well as answer commonly-asked questions. Don't
   forget the Canned Responses! That's what they're there for. If you
   need me to add more, let me know what you'd like to say. I can even
   create custom ones just for you!
2. When you're on the chat, you must check email, tickets, and Remedy.
   *Only if you have no chats, and there are no emails, requests, or
   tickets to handle, can you do other things.* This comes straight from
   Molly, and I will be enforcing this. For most of the year, night chat
   is a very cushy job. During busy times, we need your help, and you
   are being paid the same salary, so we think this is fair.
