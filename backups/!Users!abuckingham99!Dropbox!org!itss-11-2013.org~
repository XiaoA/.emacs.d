***** Respondus Question Types


**** Tegrity Support Guidelines
***** Obtain as much information as possible from the user, including:
- OS
- browser(s)
- the exact course site and name of the recording
- What exactly does the user see, and how far can he or she get before it "doesn't work?"



***** Tell the user, "I'm going to test the video. While I'm doing that, could you go to this site, and run the browser settings?"
***** Test the recording. *Whenever possible, test the recording, even if you are sure it is not a Tegrity outage*. This will accomplish two things:
- It will prove to the student that Tegrity is not the problem, which will make it more likely that the user will trust you and follow your instructions.
- It will ensure that there really isn't a problem with Tegrity or the Tegrity server.

Hello,

Which browser are you using? It sounds like your cookies are not set up to allow you to use Starfish.
Please see if the directions in this guide help: http://feedjit.com/static/howToEnableThirdPartyCookies.html

Because this is not actually a Blackboard issue, I’m going to forward this to David Fundakowski. If you are still having problems, please let him know more details about your computer, including:
-	Mac or PC
-	Which browser (IE, Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
-	Your SSO username

I hope this helps.
