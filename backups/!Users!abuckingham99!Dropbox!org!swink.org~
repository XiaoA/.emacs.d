** January 22, 2014 Meeting
On 1/22/2014, Andy Goodenow, Doug Swink, and Andrew Buckingham met to discuss how ITS approves Add/Remove requests from the Blackboard BBUR Request System. Andrew reported that ITS staff would go to BBUR, check that the person making the request was an instructor, and then approve the request. This is not in keeping with our UMKC Blackboard enrollment policies. 

This document will outline the process. 

*** Policies and Procedures
**** Course Site Requests (Add/Remove Enrollment)

*Policies*
- Instructors can request the enrollment of Instructors, Teaching Assistants, Course Builders, and Graders through the Blackboard User Request System (BBUR).
- Requests to add students to course sites without using Pathway (e.g., to finish an incomplete cannot be made through the Request System. Instructors must contact the Registrar directly at registrar@umkc.edu.
- All requests to add users to Blackboard course sites must be approved by the Registrar's office (for more information, see the [[http://www.umkc.edu/ia/it/blackboard/bbpolicies.aspx#enrollment][UMKC Blackboard Enrollment Policies]] page for more details).
- Only Instructors (or someone authorized to act on their behalf, such as a Department Chair or a Blackboard Administrator) can make requests through the BBUR Request System. Once ITS receives the request, we will send it to the "UMKC Blackboard Enrollment" distribution list (umkcblackboardenrollment@umkc.edu) and await Registrar Approval. Once ITS has received that approval, we will create a list and send it to the 'UMKC Blackboard Enrollment' mail distribution list.

*ITS staff can enoll users without Registrar approval in the following cases:*
- Requests to enroll users are Course Builders
- Requests to enroll users in Sandbox/Development sites for testing and future site preparation

*Procedures*
1. Instructors will submit Add Requests on BBUR.
2. ITS will gather a list of the requests and email them to the [[mailto:umkcblackboardenrollment@umkc.edu][UMKC Blackboard Enrollment]] email distribution list (umkcblackboardenrollment@umkc.edu).

- For most organization sites, ITS can approve these requests without approval. In the case of an Academic Site with student data, such as "Drug Calculations Exam," ITS will confirm enrollment of Leaders with the appropriate academic unit.
