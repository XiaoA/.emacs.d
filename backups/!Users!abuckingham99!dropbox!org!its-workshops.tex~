\begin{block}{Cheating is not a new problem}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Why do students cheat?}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Brent/Atkisson (2011) study}
The authors site a classic study by Sykes and Matza (1957) that postulates five neutralization techniques. 
\begin{block}{Five Neutralizations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Denial of reponsibility
\item Denial of injury
\item Denial of the victim
\item Condemnation of the condemners
\item Appeal to higher authority
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Technology is not a perfect solution, but ITS does offer several ways to help reduce the problem.}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Ways to prevent/reduce cheating}
\begin{block}{Blackboard}
\begin{itemize}
\item Set up a well-organized site that is easy for students to use
\begin{itemize}
\item Clear Course Objectives
\item Clear Path to all discussions, assignments, and assessments
\end{itemize}
\item Include useful documentation
\begin{itemize}
\item Syllabus: Clearly outline your expectations, and what to do if they have a problem
\item Bb Testing Taking tips
\item Links to the ITS Homepage, Java, etc.
\end{itemize}
\item Group Assignments
\begin{itemize}
\item Break assignments down, and make each student accountable at every step
\item Moderate/supervise projects at key mileposts
\item Delegate authority
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Blackboard Retention Center}
\emph{Blackboard Retention Center is a new tool that replaces the Early Warning System. It helps instructors view student progress and target students who are falling behind. You can create custom rules, but the defaults are very powerful and allow you to use the feature out of the box.}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Wimba/Bb Collaborate}
Wimba and Bb Collaborate are both actively supported for SP2013 at UMKC, but Blackboard will no longer (get language from website)
We recommend that instructors begin transitioning to Bb Collaborate.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Bb Collaborate}
Bb Collaborate allows instructors to interact with students in real-time.
\begin{itemize}
\item Voice/Video chat
\item Typed (IM) chat
\item Simple polling options (e.g., raising hands, check marks, etc.)
\item PowerPoint Presentations and whiteboard collaboration
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Bb Collaborate}
Conduct your lessons completely online\ldots{}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Bb Collaborate}
Or hold Virtual Office Hours!
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Blackboard Tests}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create randomized questions/answers
\item Assign different questions to each student
\item Do not include anything that was not covered in class or the readings
\item Encourage students to set up their computers correctly before the test 
\begin{itemize}
\item Use a 'practice test'
\end{itemize}
\item Respondus LockDown Browser and Tegrity Proctoring are useful supplements to prevent cheating (They can be used together to remotely proctor student exams).
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Respondus LockDown Browser}
Prevents students from accessing other websites or chat programs
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Tegrity Proctoring}
Provides visual supervision of students as they take the test.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Turnitin Assignments}
\url{http://www.umkc.edu/ia/it/turnitin/}
Turnitin includes three integrated tools:
\begin{itemize}
\item Orginality Review (plagarism detection tool)
\item GradeMark (paperless grading system)
\item PeerMark (peer evaluation review)
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Creating a Turnitin Assignment in Blackboard}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Submitting a paper through the Turnitin website}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{I suspect my students of cheating? What next?}
\begin{itemize}
\item First, organize your thoughts. Make a note of all the details (e.g., the name of the assignment, the date range, why you suspect the student)
\item Contact our office with these details. We might need more information or authorization from a Department Chair or Dean.
\item We'll do our best to find as much evidence as we can to help you make a determination.
\end{itemize}
