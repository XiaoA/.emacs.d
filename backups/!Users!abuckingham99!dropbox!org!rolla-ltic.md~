Kelly - Waiting for dev environment to be cloned
Terry - April data release 

-   update/install environment

-   4 60-minute webinar

-   SP14 instance installed

-   waiting for ICM instance to be created/ security

-   internal performance testing group - pushed to May

-   CSG very slow in building out; frustrating

# Discussion about why our UMKC Dev clone took too long

As you requested, I asked the group why our Dev clone took so long, and conveyed your concern for the length of time. I asked what kind of guarantees we would have that we could get a clone of our production Bb set up quickly, as two weeks was not going to cut it. 

According to Kelly and Terry, the reason the dev system took so long to clone is because you had to start completely from scratch, and there are millions of tiny, recursive folders with files in them. For the production server, you have two backups, which can be mounted and restored to whatever time you'd like.

They outlined a bit about the specs for the system.

## ECM filers

(Kelly)

-   Backups stored at 2 data centers, written in parallel; database data can be restored from either in a matter of hours, at worst

-   Restoring is a simple matter of re-mounting the drive.


## Daily Process

(Kelly, Kevin, and Terry)

-   around 2 or 3 am Activity Accumulator moved to stats

-   Data guard archive about every 15 minutes written during busy times; longer during slow periods (15 min is the limit recommended by Oracle)

-   middle of the night backup disk - tape -> off-site

## Example

Somewhere between 10am and 10:35am, there was a total failure.
You're not sure when the issue occurred, but you think it's around 10:00am. 
You can roll back to 9:59am.

If you're using current content, anything afer 10:00 would be orphaned.

The content file system /database (nightly log backup) separate, so if the content system is fine, you can just remount it and then go back to the time before the incident happened

Kevin said he is working with you on a new MOU.

# App Dynamics

(Kelly)

-   very useful for monitoring and reporting

-   Java hooks for monitoring

-   Blackboard also uses App Dynamics for reporting and accessing data without the need to actually log in to the local system.

# Canvas

The big topic of the day was the news that the faculty committee at Rolla has endorsed Canvas.

## The Rolla Faculty Committee has endorsed Canvas Pilot

-   The decision came much faster than expected

-   Faculty/students very enthusiastic

-   A cost of ownership study is underway (This was the last thing they looked at, because they wanted to focus on the merits of the two systems first.)
    
    -   Canvas will significantly cheaper than Bb ($100,000 less)

-   Conversion costs: They're working with other instutitons and Canvas to estimate these.

-   18-month parallel environment

-   Increased support

-   Working with Michigan Tech and other campuses that have converted to Canvas

-   Meg: The advantages of UM System all using the same LMS are not being discounted lightly, but there is a precedent for having a different system.
