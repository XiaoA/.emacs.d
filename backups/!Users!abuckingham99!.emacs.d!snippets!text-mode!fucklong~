Fuck you, $1! You are $2 and you can kiss my ass! And the same thing goes for $3. I'm not going to let either of you make my life miserable anymore. You love to $4, and $3 loves to $5. But I don't care. You can both go fuck off, because I've got better things to do with my time!

And I don't know why you're looking all shocked and amazed, $3! You've been a real $6 for a long time. I just finally got the balls to tell you. You support $1 even when it's clear that I'm right, and $1's wrong. So what do you want me to say to you? You're a $6. That's all I can say.

$1 has a lot of friends and allies, but so do I. And in the end, I don't care. You can both enjoy spending the rest of your miserable lives in this hellhole of a department. It's like i always say, "The best revenge is living well." But I usually don't follow that advice. Luckily, thanks to you two, I've finally reached a point where I can. 

$3, I brought you a piece of cake, but I threw it in the trash. $1 ate it before I could take it back. I guess that's what happens when you don't come in until 2pm and act like you rule the world. (Hint: you don't!)
