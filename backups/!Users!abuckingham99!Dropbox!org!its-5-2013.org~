***** Respondus Question Types


**** Tegrity Support Guidelines
***** Obtain as much information as possible from the user, including:
- OS
- browser(s)
- the exact course site and name of the recording
- What exactly does the user see, and how far can he or she get before it "doesn't work?"



***** Tell the user, "I'm going to test the video. While I'm doing that, could you go to this site, and run the browser settings?"
***** Test the recording. *Whenever possible, test the recording, even if you are sure it is not a Tegrity outage*. This will accomplish two things:
- It will prove to the student that Tegrity is not the problem, which will make it more likely that the user will trust you and follow your instructions.
- It will ensure that there really isn't a problem with Tegrity or the Tegrity server.

** April 2013 Report

1. Projects and Areas of Responsibility
   - Documentation and User Training
     * Website: The Tegrity documentation for Firefox was incorrect. ([[http://www.umkc.edu/ia/it/tegrity/documents/firefox-settings.pdf]["Firefox Browser Settings"]]) I corrected the information and converted the list to an ordered list.
     * OneNote: I created or edited 48 OneNote documents.
     * NewsByte: I submitted an article announcing our Open Lab hours for May.
     * User Training
       + One-On-One Training: I had three one-on-one training sessions with faculty members.
       + Workshops: I conducted one workshop: Respondus Training, April 26th. Two participants.
     * Respondus: In preparation for the workshop, I created a lot of new documentation
       - I edited the official User Guide to improve readability in some sections. I will replace the file after I finish the rest of the document.
       - I created simpler guides, including an extensive "visual guide" and templates for importing different kinds of question types. I am planning on adding even more documentation for an entirely online Respondus training workshop, which I hope to begin offering this summer.
         
   - Staff Training and Development
     * Staff Meetings: Once again, I met with all of the staff. We talked about Tegrity training, summer schedules, and I asked if they had any preferences for upcoming training. They said that the Tegrity training was valuable, and they all requested Wimba and Respondus training. After the end of the semester, I will have them work on Respondus training, using material that I've already developed for the Respondus Workshop training. 
     * Tegrity
       - Our staff continue to express their uncertainty about exactly how to resolve Tegrity issues, based on the symptoms that our users describe. I've been working with Ali to try to improve this. I wrote a fairly detailed description of how I diagnose Tegrity issues. After asking Ali to look it over, I emailed it to our staff. They said it helped a lot, but they still brought up a few more questions. I told them what I thought was the answer, and verified those answers with Ali, as well. 
   - Other
     - I made extensive improvements to our Respondus documentation (including the User Guide, itself.)
     - Installed Snagit on all the Call Center computers

       
1. Challenges
   When I did my Respondus Workshop, none of the computers were set up correctly. We determined the next week that Respondus was not installed properly on the workstations. When the computers are updated at the end of the month, this will be resolved.
2. Goals
   - Workshops: I will be giving a number of workshops and one-on-one training sessions in the coming months.
   - Documentation: This summer, our staff will work on improving our internal/external documentation.
   - Documentation: I would like to also redo our employee training. Some of our documents are outdated or incorrect, and we need completely new documentation for Live Chat and Remedy.

| Update Staff Training Documentation | Active   | Last semester, we only had a folder of documentation, with little organization. I've been working on improving and updating the organization. I hope that eventually, our Student Assistants will be able to take over at least some of the training. |

| Remedy Template Ideas               | On Hold  | Jing and I submitted our first set. I would like to add more later.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Staff Training                      | Active   | Dante and Brittney can work by themselves. They're both able to answer email, phone, and chat. They're making good progress.                                                                                                                          |
| Live Chat canned responses          | Inactive | I've created a number of canned responses and useful links, available at the press of a button, to everyone working on the chat. I will probably add more later...                                                                                    |
| Feher Performance Plan              | Active   | Feher seems to be doing better. I will continue to work with him to make sure he continues to perform well.                                                                                                                                           |

Hey everyone,

We're currently working with Tegrity to figure out why users are having issues playing Tegrity though Blackboard. For now, we can have them go to http://roocasts.umkc.edu. But please make sure that you communicate the following:

- Make sure you know the OS and browser they're using, and make a note of it, or have them write that in the chat or email.
- Find out when they were last able to access Tegrity.
- Let them know that going to roocast.umkc.edu is just a temporary solution; they should be able to use Blackboard again in the future.

 Blackboard Test-taking Tips & Tricks for Students
Before the First Test
Make sure you use a Blackboard-certified or -compatible browser Browsers with these ratings have been extensively
tested to ensure that they will perform well with all of Blackboard’s critical features, including testing tools. (List of
Supported Browsers for Blackboard 9.1)
Add umkc.edu as a trusted site Make sure you add the umkc.edu domain as a trusted site in your browser’s security
settings to ensure that content won’t be blocked. If you need assistance with this, please contact the UMKC Call Center at
816-235-6700.
Disable your popup blocker for umkc.edu domain If you don’t disable your popup blocker, the test may not be able to
fully display. If you need assistance with this, please contact the UMKC Call Center at 816-235-2000.
Run through the Blackboard browser tester The Browser Test module is located near the bottom of the left-hand side
of the Blackboard login page. Click the <Run Browser Check> button to make sure your browser is optimally configured
for Blackboard.
Take the practice test If your instructor has provided a practice test, make sure that you access it at least 24 hours prior
to the start date of your first online assessment in order to provide sufficient time to fix any problems that you may
discover.
During the Test
Wait until the test loads completely Depending on your PC and internet connection speed, it may take a little while to
load a quiz, especially if the quiz is long. Make sure that, when accessing a quiz, you only click the link once. If you click a
second time, you may find yourself locked out and unable to access the test.
Carefully read all instructions Depending on your instructor’s quiz settings, students who leave the test for any reason –
for instance, to review material on another website or in another area of the Blackboard course site -- may find themselves
unable to return to complete the quiz. If the instructions for taking the quiz are not clear, please check with your instructor.
Write answers to essay questions in Word or Notepad Losing your work on an essay question you’ve put a lot of
thought and work into answering is a frustrating and heartbreaking experience! Give yourself a safety net by writing your
answers in Word or Notepad and then pasting them into the Blackboard test window. If problems should occur with test
submission, you will have a backup of your work.
Don’t double-click the <Save> or <Submit> buttons: Double-clicking may cause an error message and delay
submission of your answers. If you click <Save> or <Submit> and nothing seems to be happening, wait 60 seconds and
try again. If you get a blank page, an error message, or no confirmation that your test has been saved or submitted,
please follow the steps in the “What if Problems Occur” section below.
Be cautious with the <Backspace> key When using the <backspace> key to correct errors, make certain that your
cursor is within the text-entry field. Hitting <Backspace> when the cursor is elsewhere on the page may cause your
browser to return to the previously-displayed page and prevent you from re-accessing a test that allows a signle attempt.
Navigating through the test Do not use your browser's "Back" button, the <Backspace> key, or <ALT> + Left Arrow to
navigate to a previous page; use Blackboard's navigation tools instead.
Be cautious about resizing the test window Some browsers will refresh the screen when you resize the window. This
should not be an issue for students who are using a Blackboard-compatible browser (List of Supported Browsers for
Blackboard 9.1)
When Problems Occur
Technology is not problem-free, and it’s possible that at some point in your university career you will run into a problem
during a test, despite following all of the instructions listed above. If this happens:
Don’t touch anything Waiting a few minutes to see if the issue resolves by itself is generally a safe first step. For
example, if there is a temporary problem with the Blackboard server, the restart process takes about two minutes. If you
wait, the test will resume at the point where it left off; however, if you press buttons or attempt to reload the test page, you
will get a “Page Not Found” error and (depending on the test settings) may lose all of your test answers as well as being
blocked from re-accessing the test.
Call ITS Call Instructional Technologies at 816-235-6700. ITS staff can let you know if there are system-wide issues
affecting Blackboard, attempt to fix your problem, and advise you how to proceed. You can also use the live online chat
support by clicking the link on the Blackboard login page or at http://www.umkc.edu/ia/its.
Take a screenshot If the problem occurs after office hours, take a screenshot of your test window and any error
messages displayed. If your test answers are still visible, make certain that you get all of your answers in a screenshot. As
well as helping to identify the problem, these screenshots will also document your work on the test to the point when the
problem occurred.
Contact your instructor It’s best to open a line of communication with your instructor as soon as testing problems occur.
In a case where test responses have been lost or you are unable to re-access a test, the decision about how to proceed is
ultimately up to the instructor. Most faculty will include general information about their course policies related to online
testing in the class syllabus.

****** *Make sure you are using the latest version of Java.* Go to [[http://www.java.com]] and click on the "Do I have Java?" link, and then on "Verify Java Installation." If you do not have the latest version of Java, click on the "Download" link at the top, and follow the directions to install Java.

** TODO Add to OneNote

In 95% of cases, a user’s Blackboard account will update automatically if their SSO user ID is changed.
 
The only exceptions are cases where either there is no connection between the Blackboard and SSO accounts (e.g. the Bb account was created manually, or the connection was deliberately broken in order to allow the user continued Blackboard access despite not being enrolled, etc.) or there is a data mismatch between what Blackboard has for the user’s student/employee ID number and what AD has.
 
In those cases, a second Blackboard account will be automatically created when the Bb/AD data synch runs and the two Bb accounts will need to be manually merged (ideally before the user logs in and starts generating separate user data under the new user_id.)
 
When a user logs into Blackboard, the authentication process first
checks whether the username given matches a username in AD. If it
does, that user authenticates against AD. Only if the Blackboard
username doesn’t match anything in AD does authentication fail through
to the Bb users table.

** Nancy Murdock remove member email
Professor,

Here is a list of all the current leaders in your organization. The members could have been added by any of these Leaders, or possibly by Leaders who are no longer active in the organization.

| SSO ID     | First Name     | Last Name | Email Address        | Role   |
|------------+----------------+-----------+----------------------+--------|
| andersonpp | Pamela         | Anderson  | andersonpp@umkc.edu  | Leader |
| wma628     | William        | Anderson  | wma628@mail.umkc.edu | Leader |
| berkell    | Laverne        | Berkel    | BerkelL@umkc.edu     | Leader |
| scvcd      | Soo Whan       | Choi      | scvcd@mail.umkc.edu  | Leader |
| rk9r7      | Richa Rajendra | Khanna    | rk9r7@mail.umkc.edu  | Leader |

Organization members must be removed in the same way they were
added. In other words, if a member is added manually by us, they must
be removed by us; if they were added in the Request System by a
leader, they would need to be removed by that Leader.

I checked the Request System, and found the following members have been added through the Request System. (I can only see members added since 5/16/2012, as that is the earliest record I can access in the Request System.) All of these members could be removed through the system by you:

| Time     | Date       | Organization ID                      | Last Name          | First Name | SSO ID      | Requested By  |

There could be members who were added before 5/16. Without knowing the names of the members you'd like to remove, I suspect that some or all of them might have been added manually by us. We received an email from Soo Whan Choi, asking us to add a group of members on 8/21/2012. Those members can be removed manually by us.

If you have any members that you'd like to remove, and that you are unable to remove through the Request System, please send us a list of their names and SSO usernames, and we'll be happy to help.

** May 23, 2013 Staff Meeting
*** Andrew's Input
I plan on focusing on training and documentation this summer. If you have any projects that you'd like our staff to work on, please feel free to ask them, and/or let me know.
**** Training
Feedback on the Tegrity training was very positive. I am planning on continuing to train our staff on the following products:
- Respondus
- Wimba
- Campus Pack
If you have any other suggestions, or would like to propose other areas where our staff can improve their knowledge, please let me know.
**** Documentation
We're off to a good start with the website, and OneNote is proving to be a valuable tool. We still have a lot of weaknesses in our internal/external documentation. I know that David is working with Kelsey and James are working on videos. We also need a lot more PDFs. I also have found some problems with where information is placed. I've made notes on that and will either change that myself or give that to Kelsey and James.

I will oversee the following documentation projects:
- Updated Remedy tutorials
- Chat tutorials
- Updating the overall ITS Student Staff Training (I've asked recent new hires to keep notes and submit problems that they discovered.)
- More turnkey tutorials in OneNote for common issues (Personally, I'm averaging about 1.5 new OneNotes per day...). 
- More website tutorials
**** Other
- Bug testing
- Temporary Projects at your discretion...?
*** Meeting Notes
**** Strategic Departmental Goals: We need to define service goals and show how we've met them. (We need a framework that shows how we set goals and how we meet them).
***** TODO Define a set of goals or metrics for showing the quality and impact of our service.
**** Monthly Reports
***** Andy mostly cares about updates and new rollouts.
**** Starfish
***** TODO find out what calls we've had about Starfish so far.
**** Tech Learning Lab 
- We need new training
- We need a space for training (Miller-Nichols 121...?)
***** TODO Check out [[http://www.tidebreak.com/][Tidebreak]] software
