***** Respondus Question Types


**** Tegrity Support Guidelines
***** Obtain as much information as possible from the user, including:
- OS
- browser(s)
- the exact course site and name of the recording
- What exactly does the user see, and how far can he or she get before it "doesn't work?"



***** Tell the user, "I'm going to test the video. While I'm doing that, could you go to this site, and run the browser settings?"
***** Test the recording. *Whenever possible, test the recording, even if you are sure it is not a Tegrity outage*. This will accomplish two things:
- It will prove to the student that Tegrity is not the problem, which will make it more likely that the user will trust you and follow your instructions.
- It will ensure that there really isn't a problem with Tegrity or the Tegrity server.

***** Working team updates
- *Kelly – Tech team update*
  - AM conference to prepare for afternoon call with Bb
  - BTB shared tickets make it easy for us to reference issues on other UM campuses
  - Upgrade was fairly smooth
  - SP15 for next update (?)
  - Starfish
    - Advisor access to Bb - What level will be appropriate?
    - What about inactive course sites, where the instructors don't use Blackboard?

- *Angie/Danna – Training and support update*
  - No updates now

  - Planning to bring in Instructional Designers to help plan development

  - Per campus survey needed:

    - Support Personnel
    - Instructional Designers

- *Marcel – Digital content update*
  - *1st Quarter*
    - Equella permission issues (other than UMKC)
  - *2nd Quarter*
    - Kaltura permissions issues
    - Collaborate issues
  - *3rd Quarter*
    - Kaltura went into PROD
      - Went well
    - Java issues with OSX (security settings made it difficult for some users to use Java-based products; primarily with Collaborate)
  - *4th Quarter*
    - Outage issues unreported
    - Kaltura iOS app available as of 12/2/2013

- *Marcel - Kaltura governance*
  - Soft Limits : shared 10 GB (3.3GB per campus)
  - Can one campus use another campus' storage?
    - Kevin: If one campus uses more, that's fine, but if more storage purchase is required, the campus that is using the most will pay more.
  - Each campus only sees its own usage; does not know how much other campuses are using now
    - Kevin: They're working on providing Admin view access that shows all three campus-level usage.
  - Analytics not set up by default
  - Questions about streaming quotas

***** LMS review
Meg: ELI Conference S&T is driving down there: [[http://www.educause.edu/eli]]. Anyone who'd like to go is welcome to ride down with the groiup.

****** S&T LMS Review update

****** Review 2011 LTIC LMS Market Report
- Previous report recommended staying with Bb for the short term
- Relied on data from Gartner
- According to Gartner's research, Learning Stacks will become more important in the future (in the last two years, how much evidence have we seen to support this?)
- Kevin: The Learning Stack theory hasn't been proven yet. Two years ago, they looked at Bb market share and if it was the right tool. With our renewal two years out, it's a good time to look again at our LMS options.
- Meg: Initiail recommendation/proposal to look at a new LMS - April 1 might be a good deadline. 
- Angela: IT at S&T never actually chose Bb; they're currently looking at comparing Bb to other options
- Meg: Considering consistency for intercampus courses should also be a factor. If one campus drops a product, should they be forced to use/pay for it?
- Kevin: Last time, we focused on six platforms. Do we still need to focus on all of those, or just three (Bb, D2L, Canvas)?
- Implications of MACE Initiative?
  * [[http://www.fhsu.edu/teacher-scholar/current/volume4/collaboration_in/page1.html][MACE]] Initiative (Fort Hayes State)
  * CSTL [[http://cstl.semo.edu/mace/][MACE Initiative]] Site
- Meg: This is a perfect time to look at the trends in online learning and we have the opportunity to provide great value to the UM system
  * sharing licensing costs
  * improving service to end users
  * leveraging expertise

***** Collaborative project brainstorming
- Projects we can work on through the rest of the fiscal year:
  * Update LMS report
  * S&T EdTech Applications Matrix (online self-help support system)
  * Catalog of learning technologies that are supported and/or promoted by each campus. They've already put together a preliminary Excel Spreadsheet. 
    + Project Team (Starting after first of the year)
      - Andrew
      - Angie
      - (Possibly Danna?)

- Content Management
  - Marcel: Found out that Kaltura can support posting pictures and documents (even though unofficialy unsupported)

  - Kevin: Kaltura might work, but not be the best option. Options like [[https://www.box.com/enterprise/cloud-content-management/][Box]] (which MU is rolling out) might be a better option.

*** Meeting Blackboard Team Meeting
**** Topics

1. Data file archiving
   A. Right now, I try to do this every day. Is it still necessary?
      * If so, how can we set up a better system that doesn't require
        me to be the only one who does that, even on a holiday? (It's
        not hard, but I sometimes get busy and forget; automating
        something like this makes a lot more sense if we really care
        about archiving this data)
      * On 11/27, I sent an email to Duane, asking for student access
        to the N: drive. Would this be acceptable? This would allow me to delegate
        this task to students, and also allow them to check the files in the event of a problem. (If this is acceptable, would you like me to contact Foundation Services)?


2. *RESOLVED* Issues with the data files
   A. Recently, the data files were missing some users, who then got
      disabled. Have we determined a cause for this, and has it been
      resolved, and is this still a problem we need to watch out for?

3. SIS Integration
   A. Times still erratic
   B. Are we still going to change the time we do the run? If so, have we started testing on DEV?

4. From Andy: Would it make sense to not run the Integration during finals time, to avoid disruptions?
   A. Problem: It's true that we don't have as much need to enroll
      uses in sites for the next semester, but what about course
      combos, new employees, or other critical changes?

It's apparently an AJAX error that happens only with IE users. Fix seems to be to ask the user to use IE’s compatibility mode. If that doesn’t help, please let me know and I’ll look further,

    Mary, 

Have you ever heard of this error? The student is trying to upload an assignment, and she gets : Unable to get property 'bundle' of undefined or null reference

From http://www.telerik.com/community/forums/aspnet-ajax/general-discussions/getting-a-unable-to-get-property-documentelement-of-undefined-or-null-reference-error.aspx:
I had the same problem with RadMenu. The workaround is to force IE10 to run in the compatibility mode by inserting this code in the <head> :

<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="IE=9">

Hello,

In 2014, Blackboard will be completing the transition from Wimba to Bb Collaborate. Our office will be providing training support to instructors as they make this changes, so it will be essential for all of us to understand how Bb Collaborate works. 

Blackboard offers two online, self-paced courses. I'd like everyone in the Call Center to complet these  
First, you'll need to set up a new account on the [[https://trainingcenter.blackboard.com/dev_students.asp?action%3Daccount_details&new%3Dyes&misc%3D897][Bb Training Registration Center]] page.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of [1mdf[0m.  [1mdf[0m displays the amount of disk space available on the
       file system containing each file name argument.  If no file name is given, the  space  available  on  all
       currently  mounted  file systems is shown.  Disk space is shown in 1K blocks by default, unless the envi-
       ronment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.

       If an argument is the absolute file name of a disk device node containing a mounted file system, [1mdf[0m shows
       the  space available on that file system rather than on the file system containing the device node (which
       is always the root file system).  This version of [1mdf[0m cannot show the space available  on  unmounted  file
       systems,  because  on most kinds of systems doing so requires very nonportable intimate knowledge of file
       system structures.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       Show information about the file system on which each FILE resides, or all file systems by default.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
