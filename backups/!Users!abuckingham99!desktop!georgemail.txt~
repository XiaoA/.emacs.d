Hi, George.

I'm filling in for Mary, but that's in addition to my main duties as the Call Center Manager for ITS at UMKC. I was extremely busy on Tuesday; especially since we were a bit under-staffed that day. I thought I was doing the right thing by alerting you to a potential problem, rather than wait for it to become a fiasco.

I generally try to figure out how to do Mary's tasks myself, because I don't want to bother anyone, and I like to learn things myself. But on that day, I was swamped in the call center, and the instructions I had for rotating the logs were either outdated or just incorrect. I could barely handle the calls, chats, and emails we had, without worrying that we might be having a problem with some/all of our users being unable to log in.

Mary told me before to only log in to kcbbapp3. I think that before I was able to rotate the logs from there. Or maybe not. After I got your email, when I had more time, I logged on to kcbbapp1 and rotated the logs. So I figured it out myself. I've been monitoring the servers, and they're running at acceptable levels now.

My understanding was that you guys are responsible for supporting us if we have issues with the server, but I'll clarify that with Andy Goodenow. Anyway, I know that I need to log on to kcbbapp1, I'll be able to handle that one myself. 

To answer your question, I get the Bunyanesque emails, but I don't think I get the Zappix alerts. Whom do I contact for that? (And is there *anything else* that Mary has access to that I still don't?)

Thanks,

Andrew
