# My Emacs Customizations

Here's my personal set of customizations for Emacs. Feel free to use anything you like. primarily use Emacs to work in R and for web development on OSX, so these settings reflect that. Wherever possible, I've tried to give credit back to anything I've used.

Enjoy customizing Emacs!
